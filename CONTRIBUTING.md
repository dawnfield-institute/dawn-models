## üìä Code Quality Standards

### Python Style
- **PEP 8** compliance with 88-character line length
- **Type hints** for all public APIs
- **Docstrings** in Google style for all classes and functions
- **Error handling** with informative error messages

### Example Function
```python
def process_symbolic_collapse(
    input_data: torch.Tensor,
    collapse_threshold: float = 0.1,
    preserve_entropy: bool = True
) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, float]]:
    """Process input through symbolic entropy collapse.
    
    Implements the Dawn Field Theory principle of controlled
    information collapse while preserving essential structure.
    
    Args:
        input_data: Input tensor to process
        collapse_threshold: Minimum entropy for collapse trigger
        preserve_entropy: Whether to maintain entropy conservation
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (processed_tensor, metrics_dict)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If input_data is not 2D tensor
        RuntimeError: If collapse fails to converge
    """
    if input_data.dim() != 2:
        raise ValueError("Input must be 2D tensor")
        
    # Implementation here...
    
    return processed_tensor, {"entropy_preserved": 0.95}
```

### Dependencies
- **Minimize dependencies**: Only add what's essential
- **Pin versions**: Specify exact versions in requirements.txt
- **Document rationale**: Explain why each dependency is needed
