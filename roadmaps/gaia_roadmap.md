# GAIA Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development, bootstrapping, and integration plan for GAIA (Generalized Architectures for Intelligent Actualization).

---

## Milestones
- Create /gaia/ directory and define lifecycle operations
- Integrate foundational experiments and devkit tools
- Develop feedback capture and model adaptation logic
- Build modular toolkit for symbolic cognition and collapse
- Prepare agent interaction specifications and standards
- Launch interpretability and XAI infrastructure

---

## Current Priorities
- Finalize GAIA bootloader and feedback modules
- Integrate symbolic collapse and memory systems
- Document meta-cognitive trace protocols
- Prepare for ingestion of simulation and experiment data
- Audit and tag all GAIA-related files for CIP compliance

---

## Next Steps
- Launch /agents directory and agent simulation routines
- Build publication runner scripts for GAIA outputs
- Integrate CIP tagging and compliance schema into all GAIA modules
- Collaborate on cross-institutional research and benchmarking
