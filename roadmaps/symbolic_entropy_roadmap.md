# Symbolic Entropy Roadmap

This roadmap tracks research and engineering plans to refine Selective Entropy Collapse (SEC) models and related experiments.

---

## Objectives
- Formalize SEC operators and collapse metrics
- Unify SEC with SCBF benchmarks and visualizers
- Expand biological and physical alignment studies

---

## Milestones
- Define SEC operator library and reference API
- Integrate SEC metrics into SCBF (entropy_collapse, ancestry, bifractal lineage)
- Add reproducibility harness (configs, seeds, artifacts)
- Publish SEC-focused preprint appendix and notebooks

---

## Experiments
- Symbolic tree extinction vs random baselines
- Entropy-aware pruning and memory attractors
- Cross-domain tests: arithmetic motifs, signal collapse, QRNG comparisons

---

## Deliverables
- SEC operator spec and implementations
- Benchmark suite integration (SCBF) and dashboards
- Datasets and result archives with CIP metadata
