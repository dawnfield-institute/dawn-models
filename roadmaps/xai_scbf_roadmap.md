# XAI & SCBF Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the development of explainable AI (XAI) infrastructure and the Symbolic Collapse Benchmark Framework (SCBF).

---

## Milestones
- Build modular benchmarking suite for symbolic collapse
- Integrate collapse visualizers and metric modules
- Develop interpretability dashboard and narrative generation tools
- Link SCBF to TinyCIMM and other agentic models
- Publish benchmarking results and analysis
- Annotate and convert all major blueprints into rich notebooks with commentary, examples, and interactive sliders
- Set up a consistent format for linking blueprint notebooks to their corresponding simulations, storing outputs in a structured folder like `blueprints/output_data/`
- Write a detailed protocol spec for QSocket as a communication protocol for intelligent agents and swarms
- Develop QSocket simulator and use case descriptions for distributed systems
- Build entropy-traceable black-box audit tools using symbolic collapse as interpretive lens
- Validate that black-box behaviors in ML can be modeled as frozen symbolic fields under high-entropy decay

---

## Current Priorities
- Finalize SCBF architecture and metric modules
- Integrate symbolic lineage trackers and entropy alignment tools
- Document weight evolution analyzers and collapse heatmaps
- Prepare for publication and peer review of XAI results
- Benchmark CIMM vs ML vs SEC models: define experimental baselines, implement metrics (pruning rates, entropy curves, topology evolution, fractal dimension, symbolic lifespan)
- Run simulations across controlled tasks, analyze structural and entropic differences, and consolidate results into unified framework
- Design SEC collapse interface and feedback mechanisms
- Run symbolic collapse iteration experiments and visualize entropy/pruning
- Expand devkit utility offerings to include entropy mapping visualizations, topological processors, and QBE-based transformation engines

---

## Next Steps
- Expand SCBF to support new models and experiments
- Launch dashboard and visualization suite
- Collaborate on XAI standards and benchmarking protocols
- Integrate SCBF outputs into publication framework
- Build entropy mapping and interpretability protocol for symbolic persistence, attractor reactivation, and entropy rebound
- Explore direct mapping from SEC attractors to latent ML layer outputs
- Develop interpretability protocol for symbolic fossilization and neural form analysis
- Automate model scrutiny pipeline: design and implement a GitHub Actions pipeline to scrutinize new/updated documents and theories, aggregate findings, and generate structured to-do documents

---

## Preprint Pipeline
- Draft preprint series overview for XAI and SCBF research
- Prepare papers on benchmarking, interpretability, and symbolic cognition
- Document all code, figures, and protocols for open peer review
