description: 'This directory, titled "utils," is a collection of various supportive
  files and scripts that aid in the analysis and implementation of the Cosmic Information
  Mining Model (CIMM). The utils directory serves as a crucial component of CIMM,
  as it contains essential tools for data preprocessing, logging, and other utility
  functions.


  The directory comprises four main components:

  1. Data processing: This module contains data preprocessing functions that enable
  efficient and accurate processing of large datasets used in the CIMM model. Including
  but not limited to outlier removal and signal filtering using Butterworth filters.

  2. Logging: This component is responsible for managing all logs generated during
  the execution of the CIMM model. The logging module contains pre-defined functions
  for configuring log files, logging messages, and other operations.

  3. __init__.py: This file serves as a namespace for utilities and utility modules
  within the utils directory. It imports necessary dependencies, defines utility functions,
  and provides essential functionality for other components of CIMM.

  4. meta.yaml: The meta.yaml file contains metadata about the utils directory and
  its contents. It specifies the schema version used for this directory, describes
  the semantic scope (utils and CIMM), and lists all files contained within it.


  Overall, the purpose of the utils directory is to assist in the efficient and accurate
  operation of the CIMM model by providing essential utility functions and managing
  logs generated during its execution.'
