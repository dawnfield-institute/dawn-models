description: 'This directory contains optimization routines and supporting files for
  the CIMM (Cosmic Information Mining Model) core. The optimization routines are designed
  to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the CIMM model by minimizing energy
  consumption and maximizing information flow. The directory includes a meta.yaml
  file that specifies the schema version and the semantic scope, as well as a documentation
  folder that contains text files explaining the purpose and usage of each file in
  the directory.

  The optimization routines are implemented in Python code files such as adaptive_controller.py,
  bayesian_optimizer.py, and pruning.py. These files contain functions for calculating
  energy costs based on Landauer''s Principle, and other techniques for optimizing
  the CIMM model. The __init__.py file is an empty initialization file that does not
  contain any code but is required by Python to define a package directory.

  Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in the CIMM core by providing efficient
  optimization algorithms that can help reduce energy consumption and improve information
  flow within the model.'
