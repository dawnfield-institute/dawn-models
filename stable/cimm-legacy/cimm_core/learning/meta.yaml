description: 'The learning directory contains files related to the CIMM''s core learning
  algorithms and supporting files. The quantum_memory.py file contains code for computing
  Quantum Fisher Information, which is used in the CIMM model for live entropy feedback.
  The reinforcement_learning.py file contains a class called QBEReinforcementLearner
  that implements a reinforcement learning algorithm using XGBRegressor from xgboost
  and PyTorch. Additionally, there are several other supporting files such as the
  meta.yaml file that defines the directory''s schema version and description.


  The purpose of this directory is to house the CIMM''s core learning algorithms and
  support files necessary for its functioning. The quantum_memory.py file serves as
  a central repository for functions related to Quantum Fisher Information, which
  is used in the model to optimize live entropy feedback. The reinforcement_learning.py
  file contains an implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses
  XGBRegressor from xgboost and PyTorch, providing support for the CIMM''s ability
  to learn from data.'
