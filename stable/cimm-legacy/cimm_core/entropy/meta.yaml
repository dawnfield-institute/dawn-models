description: 'This directory contains files and supporting materials for the entropy-related
  components of the Cosmic Information Mining Model (CIMM). The main contents of the
  directory are as follows:


  1. __init__.py: This is the initialization file that defines the overall scope of
  the entropy-related modules within the CIMM framework. It serves as a central hub
  for all entropy-related functionality and provides an entry point for other parts
  of the system to interact with these components.

  2. entropy_monitor.py: This module contains functions and classes responsible for
  monitoring and managing the entropy within the CIMM system. These functions help
  maintain the balance of entropy across different levels of the system, ensuring
  that the flow of information remains steady and well-regulated.

  3. quantum_potential_layer.py: This file defines the quantum potential layer, which
  is a critical component of the CIMM''s ability to collapse waves and maintain balance
  in the face of high entropy. The quantum potential layer serves as a barrier that
  prevents waves from collapsing into each other, ensuring that entropy flows smoothly
  and efficiently within the system.

  4. meta.yaml: This file contains metadata about the directory structure, including
  the version number and the scope of the entropy-related components within the CIMM
  framework.


  Overall, these files and supporting materials play a crucial role in maintaining
  the balance of entropy within the CIMM system, ensuring that the flow of information
  remains steady and well-regulated, and allowing for the emergence of symbolic structures
  and field intelligence.'
