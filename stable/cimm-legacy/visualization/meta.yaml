description: "This directory contains visualization tools and supporting files for\
  \ the CIMM (Cosmic Information Mining Model) model, which is a foundational research\
  \ framework for post-symbolic artificial intelligence. The directory includes a\
  \ Python script called \"plots.py\" that imports various libraries such as Matplotlib,\
  \ NumPy, Torch, and Sympy, and defines a function called \"remove_extreme_outliers\"\
  \ to remove extreme outliers from data. The file also contains an empty initialization\
  \ file called \"\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py\".\n\n        The purpose of this directory\
  \ is to provide visualization tools for the CIMM model, which can be used to analyze\
  \ and understand the behavior of the model. By removing extreme outliers from the\
  \ data, the visualization tools can help users gain insights into the stability\
  \ and convergence of the model's output in semantic space. The directory structure\
  \ emphasizes the importance of the visualization tools in the overall project, highlighting\
  \ their role as a crucial component for understanding the CIMM model."
