description: 'The directory "models" in the CIMM repository is where all the model
  definitions for the Cosmic Information Mining Model (CIMM) are stored. The models
  contained within this directory are designed to perform tasks related to post-symbolic
  artificial intelligence, such as live entropy feedback, wave collapse equilibrium,
  and recursive field dynamics. These models are built using principles of entropy
  flow, collapse dynamics, and field-theoretic stabilization, which are core components
  of the CIMM framework.


  In addition to the model definitions, this directory also contains supporting files
  for each model, such as configuration files, documentation, and code for training
  and testing the models. The meta.yaml file in this directory defines the schema
  version, directory name, description, semantic scope, and files that make up the
  CIMM repository.


  Overall, the models stored within this directory are essential to the functioning
  of the CIMM framework and play a critical role in enabling the AI system to learn,
  reason, and adapt to its environment.'
