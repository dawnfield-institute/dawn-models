description: 'This directory contains the results of analyzing the prime number structure
  using the Cosmic Information Mining Model (CIMM). The contents include files that
  contain error metrics for different distance measures, such as Kullback-Leibler
  divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and Wasserstein distance. There is also a
  file called meta.yaml, which contains metadata about the directory, including its
  name, description, and semantic scope. The directory also includes a text file called
  error_metrics.txt, which provides a list of error metrics for different distance
  measures.


  The purpose of this directory is to store and share the results of analyzing the
  prime number structure using the CIMM model. It is important to note that this is
  not a standard directory for storing data files, but rather a custom directory created
  for this specific project. The contents of this directory are designed to provide
  a detailed analysis of the prime number structure and its relationship to the CIMM
  model.'
