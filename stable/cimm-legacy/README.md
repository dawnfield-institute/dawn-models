# ðŸŒŒ CIMM Core â€” Entropy-Based Intelligence Engine

*CIMM is currently being migrated, use cases currently will fail until migration is complete.*

CIMM (Cosmic Information Mining Model) is a foundational research framework for **post-symbolic artificial intelligence**, built on principles of **entropy flow**, **collapse dynamics**, and **field-theoretic stabilization**.

This is **not** a symbolic system. It doesn't use tokens, logic gates, or conventional training pipelines. Instead, CIMM learns through **live entropy feedback**, **wave collapse equilibrium**, and **recursive field dynamics**. It creates structure through **stabilized emergence**, not gradient descent.

## ðŸ§¬ Core Philosophy

> Intelligence is not optimization over symbols â€” it is **recursive collapse resolution** in a field of entropy and potential.

- **No static training** â€” each run instantiates a new model that learns from real-time collapse feedback.
- **No symbolic reasoning** â€” cognition arises from balancing entropy gradients and memory deviation.
- **No external supervision** â€” systems self-regulate based on energy-information equilibrium.

## ðŸ§  Agentic Framework (CIMM Runtime)

CIMM is designed to run **multiple agents** in a shared mesh, each with its own:
- Entropy monitor
- Adaptive reinforcement core
- Memory predictor
- Quantum potential stabilizer

Each agent operates as a **self-contained intelligence kernel**, and can:
- Share internal entropy signatures
- React to collapse deviations
- Prune and restructure its architecture on the fly
- Seek internal coherence and field balance

### ðŸ”§ Components:
| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `cimm.py` | Master orchestrator â€” manages a single entropy-driven learning core |
| `cimm_core.py` | Core logic for agent feedback, learning, and collapse forecasting |
| `cimm_core_manager.py` | Manager of multiple CIMM agents; synchronizes entropy, feedback, and state |
| `base_agent.py` | Base class for entropy-sensitive agents with adaptive cognition |
| `supervisor_agent.py` | Consensus arbiter â€” manages trust, collapse thresholds, and convergence in multi-agent systems |
| `agentic_mesh_runtime.py` | Threaded runtime for distributed agent execution |

Each agent adapts **without external training** â€” learning happens **in-the-moment**, guided by entropy stabilization.

## ðŸ§ª Key Concepts

### ðŸŒ€ Post-Symbolic Intelligence
No symbols. No tokens. Just **entropy gradients**, **wave collapse**, and **coherence stabilization**.

### ðŸ§  Live Learning
Models are **born fresh each run** â€” no pickles, no checkpoints. Intelligence is a process, not a file.

### ðŸ“‰ Entropy as Feedback
CIMM uses real-time entropy change to:
- Adapt structure
- Select hyperparameters
- Control internal learning dynamics

### ðŸ§¬ Collapse-Based Memory
Memory isnâ€™t storage â€” itâ€™s **pattern deviation prediction**. CIMM recalls by anticipating collapse shifts.

## ðŸ§ª Running CIMM Experiments

You can run **single-agent CIMM experiments** out of the box using the provided use cases:

- **Stock Prediction:**  
  `python usecase/stock_prediction_usecase.py`
- **Prime Structure Modeling:**  
  `python usecase/prime_structure_usecase.py`

**ðŸ“Š [Prime Structure Modeling Results â†’](./prime_number_results.md)**

Each script demonstrates a live, entropy-driven CIMM run on real or synthetic data.

> **Agentic (multi-agent) use cases are finished internally and will be migrated soon.**  
> Stay tuned for distributed mesh experiments and collaborative field learning.
