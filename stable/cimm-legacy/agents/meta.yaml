description: 'This directory structure represents the implementation of various agents
  that work with the Cosmic Information Mining Model (CIMM) framework. The agents
  in this directory are designed to perform specific tasks, such as base, supervisor,
  and specialized agents. Each agent has its own unique functionality and is responsible
  for a particular aspect of the CIMM framework.


  The purpose of this directory is to provide a comprehensive set of agents that can
  work together to perform complex information mining tasks. The agents in this directory
  are designed to be highly customizable, allowing users to tailor them to their specific
  needs. Additionally, the use of different types of agents can help improve the performance
  and efficiency of the CIMM framework as a whole.


  Overall, the purpose of this directory is to serve as a central location for storing
  and managing all of the agents that work with the CIMM framework, providing a structured
  approach to developing and deploying these agents. The various agents in this directory
  can be used together to perform a wide range of information mining tasks, from simple
  symbolic reasoning to complex field-theoretic stabilization.'
