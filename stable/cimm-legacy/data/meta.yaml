description: "This directory contains data files and supporting datasets for the Cosmic\
  \ Information Mining Model (CIMM) experiments and analysis. The directory_name field\
  \ in the meta.yaml file specifies that the directory is named \"data\" and provides\
  \ a brief description of its contents. \nThe semantic_scope field identifies the\
  \ CIMM model as the primary context for these data files. The files section lists\
  \ two files, with the amd_full_... file listed first. The overall purpose of this\
  \ directory appears to be supporting the CIMM framework by providing data and datasets\
  \ necessary for experimentation and analysis.\nIt is likely that the data in this\
  \ directory pertains to the model's behavior and performance under different conditions\
  \ or scenarios, which could be used to test its effectiveness, identify areas of\
  \ improvement, and study how it develops over time. The documentation section also\
  \ includes five files, providing an overview or further context for the data contained\
  \ in the directory."
