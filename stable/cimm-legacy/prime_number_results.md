# 🧠 Prime Structure Prototype — CIMM + QBE Intelligence Test

This prototype demonstrates structural field learning over prime number deltas using the **Cosmic Information Mining Model (CIMM)** and **Quantum Balance Equation (QBE)**. It is the first full-scale test of information-driven intelligence emergence over a mathematically chaotic sequence.

---

## 📌 Overview

* **Goal:** Learn the delta between sequential prime numbers using no symbolic math — only entropy, information feedback, and recursive refinement.
* **Why primes?** They offer high entropy, asymmetric nonlinearity, and lack traditional predictability — making them ideal for structural testing.
* **Frameworks used:**

  * **CIMM** for entropy-aware feedback and adaptive controller learning
  * **QBE** for informational collapse balance and tension reinforcement

---

## 🏧 Model Architecture

* **Inputs:** 4-length sequences of prime deltas
* **Model Core:** Fully connected PyTorch model with adaptive controller and reinforcement learning
* **Refinement Modules:**

  * `QuantumPotentialLayer` — dynamic entropy shaping
  * `EntropyMonitor` — collapse deviation tracking
  * `SuperfluidDynamics` — smooths volatility
* **Output:** Single predicted delta value

### Activation Strategy

* Output layer uses linear or bounded-positive activation (ReLU)
* Entropy curvature tuning is applied through QPL updates
* Loss is dynamically weighted by entropy feedback

---

## 🧠 Training Conditions

* **Data:** First 200,000 prime deltas
* **Training Device:** CPU (for prototype simplicity)
* **Prediction Device:** GPU (for acceleration and scalability)

---

## 📊 Final Results

* **Dataset Size:** 200,000 deltas
* **KL-Divergence:** `6.4869e-05`
* **Jensen-Shannon Divergence:** `0.0081`
* **Wasserstein Distance:** `2278.52`
* **QWCS (Quantum Wave Collapse Stability):** `0.5` ← Stable equilibrium

## 📈 Visualization

> The model visibly **locks into structural harmony** around the 60,000–180,000 mark, showing recursive resonance and informational echoing. Lower bound tracking is almost perfect; upper bound alignment improves with entropy shaping.

## 🧬 Observations

* Prediction error becomes structurally aligned over time
* Emergent intelligence responds to entropy — not memorized patterns
* Collapse modulation mirrors QBE dynamics as predicted
