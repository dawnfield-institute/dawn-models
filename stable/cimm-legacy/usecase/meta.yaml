description: 'This directory, labeled "usecase," serves as a collection of use cases
  and application examples for the CIMM model. It is part of a larger project that
  is dedicated to post-symbolic artificial intelligence and incorporates research
  from the Cosmic Information Mining Model (CIMM). The directory contains six files:
  two code files, four documentation files, and one initialization file. The code
  files are "code_optimization(unfinished).py," "fetch_stock_data.py," "prime_structure_usecase.py,"
  "stock_prediction_usecase.py," and "__init__.py." These code files employ various
  programming languages, including Python, Numba, time, Torch, and torch.nn.

  The documentation files include the schema version, directory name, description,
  semantic scope, and file list. The file list includes __init__.py, code_optimization(unfinished).py,
  fetch_stock_data.py, prime_structure_usecase.py, stock_prediction_usecase.py, and
  meta.yaml.

  The purpose of this directory is to provide examples and use cases for the CIMM
  model, highlighting its capabilities in symbolic entropy collapse, recursive balance
  fields, and adaptive learning. It also provides a minimalistic architecture for
  adaptive intelligence systems called GAIA, which can be used to analyze large data
  sets and facilitate efficient reasoning. The directory serves as an illustration
  of how these techniques can be applied in practice, offering examples of code optimization,
  stock price prediction, and more.'
