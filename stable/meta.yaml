description: 'This directory structure represents a collection of files related to
  the development and implementation of Cosmic Information Mining Model (CIMM), a
  foundational research framework for post-symbolic artificial intelligence. The directory
  is structured in a modular fashion, with separate directories for the CIMM core
  codebase and documentation, as well as supporting files such as requirements and
  readme files.


  The CIMM core codebase contains the essential components of the model, including
  the validate_imports.py file that validates the integrity of the imported modules,
  the __init__.py file that initializes the CIMM framework, and the agents/ directories
  that house the implementation of various cognitive architectures. The cimm_core/
  directory contains the primary CIMM codebase, while the cimm-legacy/ directory houses
  older versions of the model that may have been developed before the current stable
  release.


  The documentation directory includes files such as README.md and requirements.txt
  that provide an overview of the CIMM framework and its capabilities, as well as
  the results of various experiments and analyses conducted using the model. The prime_number_results.md
  file, in particular, contains a detailed analysis of the performance of the Prime
  Number Agent, which is a sample agent implemented within the CIMM framework.


  Overall, this directory structure represents a comprehensive collection of files
  related to the development and implementation of CIMM, including the core codebase,
  supporting documentation, and older versions of the model. Its purpose is to provide
  a stable and well-documented resource for researchers and developers interested
  in exploring the potential of post-symbolic artificial intelligence and the Cosmic
  Information Mining Model.'
