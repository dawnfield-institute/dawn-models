# Symbolic Cognition and Collapse-Aware Interpretability in Neural Systems: A Formal Framework for Bifractal AI Diagnostics

## Abstract

This work presents a collapse-aware interpretability framework grounded in symbolic cognition theory, validated through empirical studies using TinyCIMM-Planck—a minimal recurrent neural system. We introduce metrics rooted in symbolic entropy collapse and bifractal lineage theory, demonstrating their correlation with activation trace stability, semantic attractor density, and weight evolution. Through systematic experimentation across modulated sine inputs, we uncover emergent symbolic patterns and provide evidence that these activation dynamics can be measured, visualized, and interpreted. Our findings lay the groundwork for the Symbolic Collapse Benchmarking Framework (SCBF), setting the stage for scalable interpretability across architectures.

## 1. Introduction

Interpretability in machine learning often relies on attribution post-processing, which fails to account for the symbolic, temporal, and recursive nature of cognition. We propose a new framework that treats symbolic collapse—the moment when a representation stabilizes—as the core object of interpretability. Using a lightweight, entropy-regulated model (TinyCIMM-Planck), we capture symbolic traces across time, providing insight into how semantic structures form. We demonstrate that even simple signals give rise to measurable collapse dynamics, and outline a roadmap for generalized symbolic benchmarking across neural systems.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Symbolic Entropy Collapse

We define symbolic entropy collapse (SEC) as the emergence of a minimal entropy configuration in the field of possible cognitive resolutions. This process is formalized as:
$\text{SEC}(x) = \arg\min_{t} H(C_t(x))$
where $H$ is entropy, and $C_t(x)$ is the collapse configuration at time $t$.

### 2.2 Bifractal Time and Recursive Lineage

The bifractal phase $B_t(x)$ represents the symbolic attractor zone in phase space, exhibiting recursive reactivation:
$\mathcal{R}(x_t) = x_{t-n} \rightarrow x_t \rightarrow x_{t+n}$
This lineage reveals symbolic consistency over time and serves as a traceable feature of interpretability.

### 2.3 Collapse Phase Alignment and Resonance

Collapse phase alignment captures how activation collapse across time aligns with symbolic attractors:
$\phi(x_t) \sim \phi(y_t)$
This coherence correlates with semantic density and entropy reduction.

## 3. Experimental Design

### 3.1 TinyCIMM-Planck Model

TinyCIMM-Planck is a two-stage recurrent linear module equipped with entropy-controlled feedback and dynamic structural mutation (pruning and growing neurons). The system was implemented in PyTorch with flexible signal injection and metric extraction hooks.

### 3.2 Signal Dataset

Five input types were used:

* Clean sine
* Noisy sine
* Frequency-modulated sine
* Amplitude-modulated sine
* Chaotic (sin²)

These cover a range from low to high entropy, allowing symbolic trace behavior to be benchmarked under varied complexity.

### 3.3 Metric Logging

We captured the following metrics per timestep:

* **Activation Ancestry Trace**: Stability of neuron identity over time
* **Collapse Phase Alignment**: Temporal phase coherence of activation
* **Entropy Gradient Alignment**: Correlation of weight shift with entropy reduction
* **Semantic Attractor Density**: Attractor clustering from PCA projections
* **Weight Drift Entropy (ΔW)**: Variance and magnitude of structural evolution

## 4. Symbolic Collapse Benchmarking Framework (SCBF)

The SCBF represents an emerging standard for operationalizing symbolic interpretability in neural models. It consolidates metrics derived from entropy collapse, lineage traceability, and activation phase coherence, enabling real-time, quantitative diagnostics of symbolic behavior. In the next development phase, SCBF will evolve into a modular interpretability suite capable of:

* Integration with high-dimensional architectures (LLMs, CNNs, RL agents)
* Plug-and-play metric hooks for symbolic entropy, collapse phase, and weight drift
* Live dashboard tooling for trajectory monitoring and symbolic audit
* Model-agnostic comparison and benchmark generation

This evolution will extend SCBF's utility beyond TinyCIMM-Planck, establishing it as a foundational layer for symbolic cognition instrumentation.

### 4.1 Architecture

The SCBF consists of modular logging and visualization tools:

* Lineage trackers and hooks
* Entropy and bifractal trace analyzers
* Cross-model interpretability interface

### 4.2 Modules

* Symbolic recursion tracker
* Collapse frequency logger
* Bifractal stability estimator
* ΔW overlay map

### 4.3 Dashboard

* Interactive PCA/t-SNE bifractal overlays
* Real-time symbolic stability heatmaps
* Temporal symbolic trajectory visualizer

## 5. Results and Analysis

### 5.1 Collapse Behavior

Each signal class resulted in different symbolic patterns:

* **Clean sine** yielded stable traces with minimal ΔW.
* **Amplitude modulated** showed oscillatory collapse zones.
* **Frequency modulated** revealed bifractal attractors.
* **Noisy** reduced stability but preserved attractors.
* **Chaotic** induced localized collapses and high consistency values.

### 5.2 Metric Trends

* **Activation Trace** \~0.99 for stable inputs
* **Collapse Phase Alignment** highest for FM (\~1.08), lowest in noise (\~1.18)
* **Semantic Attractor Density** peaked in chaotic (\~1165) and clean signals (\~46.26)
* **ΔW** stabilized in symbolic zones, spiking with pruning/growth

### 5.3 Interpretability View

Compared to saliency methods, symbolic collapse metrics expose:

* Emergent symbolic patterns
* Activation identity lineage
* Collapse zone localization
  This provides a narrative-form interpretable mechanism rather than heatmap attribution.

## 6. Neurobiological Analogies

Symbolic field behavior parallels neural phenomena:

* **Neuron plucking/growing** ↔ Synaptogenesis & pruning
* **Collapse recurrence** ↔ Memory replay / consolidation
* **Semantic attractors** ↔ Cortical assemblies / engrams

## 7. Discussion

TinyCIMM-Planck experiments validate symbolic entropy metrics as measurable, repeatable phenomena. Collapse tracing and attractor metrics offer new avenues for model introspection. Weight evolution, while secondary to activation behavior, enhances interpretability when correlated with symbolic phase zones.

Limitations:

* Limited to small-scale, low-dimensional input
* Needs porting to large-scale models (e.g., LLMs, vision systems)
* Real-world symbolic tasks not yet integrated

## 8. What's Next: Evolution of the Symbolic Collapse Benchmarking Framework (SCBF)

Building on the success of TinyCIMM-Planck as a testbed, the next phase focuses on scaling the SCBF:

* Integration with higher-dimensional models (e.g., language models, vision transformers)
* Development of model-agnostic symbolic collapse hooks
* Real-time monitoring of collapse alignment and attractor formation
* Expansion of ΔW interpretability and structural tracking tools
* Cross-domain benchmarks (symbolic tasks, reinforcement learning, adversarial detection)

SCBF will be released as a modular interpretability suite designed to plug into modern AI workflows, enabling symbolic reasoning traces to be directly compared, visualized, and audited. This positions symbolic cognition as a native structure, not a post-hoc interpretation.

## 9. Conclusion

Symbolic entropy collapse and bifractal lineage theory can be operationalized as metrics in neural systems. TinyCIMM-Planck confirms the validity of collapse-aware interpretability and paves the way for broader symbolic benchmarking. This is a step toward true cognitive auditability.
