description: "This directory structure \"experiments\" appears to contain experimental\
  \ scripts for running and benchmarking TinyCIMM-Planck and classical machine learning\
  \ models on various signals. The directory also includes documentation, including\
  \ an experiment report that summarizes the experiments conducted with TinyCIMM-Planck.\
  \ This report highlights the benefits of using minimal adaptive neural architectures\
  \ inspired by the Cognition Index Memory Model (CIM) over more conventional machine\
  \ learning models. \nIn summary, this directory appears to be a collection of code\
  \ and data used for conducting experiments with TinyCIMM-Planck. It includes scripts\
  \ for running and analyzing the model on various signals, as well as documentation\
  \ and an experiment report that summarize the findings of these experiments. The\
  \ purpose of this directory is likely to document and present the results of the\
  \ experiments, making them available for others to learn from or build upon."
