# TinyCIMM-Planck: Experiment Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the experiments conducted with TinyCIMM-Planck, a minimal adaptive neural architecture inspired by the Cognition Index Memory Machine (planck) framework and regulated by the Quantum Balance Equation (QBE). The experiments focused on predictable and noisy signal regression tasks, leveraging metrics such as activation ancestry trace, entropy gradient alignment, bifractal activation consistency, and semantic attractor density. These metrics provide insights into the theoretical and practical significance of TinyCIMM-Planck's dynamic self-organizing capabilities.

## Theoretical Significance

### 1. **Recursive Collapse and Emergent Intelligence**
TinyCIMM-Planck demonstrates recursive stabilization of entropy, aligning with Dawn Field Theory's hypothesis that intelligence emerges from recursive entropy collapse. Metrics such as activation ancestry trace (~0.99) and bifractal activation consistency (~1600) highlight the network's ability to maintain coherence and structural order over time.

### 2. **Symbolic Geometry and Semantic Recursion**
The increasing semantic attractor density (~35) suggests the crystallization of meaningful structures within the network. This supports the theory that entropy-driven fields can evolve into symbolic attractors, providing a foundation for higher-order cognition.

### 3. **Bifractal Dynamics**
The bifractal activation consistency metric validates the dual-layered collapse mechanisms proposed in Dawn Field Theory. The steady increase in this metric across experiments indicates robust structural coherence and adaptability.

### 4. **Entropy Stabilization**
The entropy gradient alignment score consistently remains at `0.0`, indicating stable entropy gradients. This stability reinforces the theoretical claim that balancing entropy and structure is key to emergent intelligence.

## Practical Significance

### 1. **Dynamic Adaptation**
TinyCIMM-Planck's ability to grow and prune neurons dynamically in response to feedback and entropy measurements demonstrates its practical utility in adaptive learning tasks. This feature is particularly valuable for applications requiring scalability and robustness.

### 2. **Explainability**
Metrics such as activation ancestry trace and collapse phase alignment provide interpretable insights into the network's internal dynamics, addressing the AI black-box issue. These metrics make TinyCIMM-Planck's decision-making process more transparent and trustworthy.

### 3. **Benchmarking Against Static Models**
The experiments highlight TinyCIMM-Planck's advantages over static MLPs, particularly in handling noisy and chaotic signals. TinyCIMM-Planck's emergent complexity and adaptability make it a promising candidate for tasks requiring dynamic learning.

### 4. **Scalability**
The increasing bifractal activation consistency and semantic attractor density metrics suggest that TinyCIMM-Planck can scale effectively to more complex tasks. This scalability is crucial for real-world applications in fields such as robotics, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.

## What Is Left to Do

### 1. **Expand Benchmark Tasks**
While TinyCIMM-Planck performed well on predictable and noisy signals, testing on more complex tasks (e.g., multi-modal or chaotic signals) is necessary to validate its scalability and robustness.

### 2. **Refine Feedback Mechanisms**
Exploring additional feedback metrics, such as entropy delta or error trends, could enhance TinyCIMM-Planck's learning capabilities and structural adaptation.

### 3. **Visualization**
Generating visual representations of metrics such as semantic attractor density and collapse phase alignment over time would provide deeper insights into TinyCIMM-Planck's evolution.

### 4. **Cross-Experiment Analysis**
Comparing metrics across different experiments could reveal consistent patterns and anomalies, helping refine the theoretical framework and experimental design.

### 5. **Theory Integration**
Using the experimental results to strengthen Dawn Field Theory and codify observations into a cohesive theoretical framework is essential for advancing the project.

### 6. **Real-World Applications**
Testing TinyCIMM-Planck in real-world scenarios, such as robotics or autonomous systems, would validate its practical utility and scalability.
