description: 'This directory structure represents the TinyCIMM-Planck project, which
  focuses on developing an ultra-minimal agentic model for symbolic cognition and
  recursive collapse. The project is centered around the concept of Symbolic Entropy
  Collapse, where entropy gradients drive the formation of symbolic structures.


  The directory contains a total of 273 files, with 10 code files related to the TinyCIMM-Planck
  model and its experiments. The documentation includes several markdown files, including
  a report on the project''s goals, an explanation of fractal interpretability, and
  a plan for the documentation.


  The meta.yaml file contains metadata for the directory, including the schema version,
  which indicates the level of organization and structure used in the project. The
  description field provides additional information about the purpose and scope of
  the project, with a semantic scope that includes TinyCIMM-Planck, model, and other
  relevant terms.


  Overall, this directory structure represents an ongoing research project focused
  on developing and refining the TinyCIMM-Planck model for symbolic cognition and
  recursive collapse, using principles of entropy flow, wave collapse equilibrium,
  and field-theoretic stabilization. The project aims to provide insight into deep
  mathematical structures that emerge during learning through entropy analysis, demonstrating
  how lightweight, entropy-informed architectures can achieve adaptive learning, symbolic
  memory, and field-based intelligence using Dawn Field Theory principles.'
