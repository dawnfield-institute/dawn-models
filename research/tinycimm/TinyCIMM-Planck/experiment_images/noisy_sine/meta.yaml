description: "The noisy_sine directory contains code files that implement a sine function\
  \ with noise added. It is designed to generate noise-corrupted versions of the original\
  \ sine wave for testing and evaluation purposes. The purpose of this directory is\
  \ to provide a tool for experimenting with different types of noise and their effects\
  \ on signal quality and performance.\n    \n    The code files in this directory\
  \ are intended to be modified and used as needed to create different noise patterns,\
  \ such as white noise, pink noise, or specific frequency ranges. This allows the\
  \ user to test the robustness of algorithms under various noise conditions and evaluate\
  \ their performance.\n    \n    The documentation included in this directory provides\
  \ information on how to use the code files and their outputs. It also explains the\
  \ mathematical principles behind the noise generation process and offers insights\
  \ into the effects of different types of noise on signal processing tasks."
