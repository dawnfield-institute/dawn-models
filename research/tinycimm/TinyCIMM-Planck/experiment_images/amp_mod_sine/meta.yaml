description: "The \"amp_mod_sine\" directory contains code and documentation files\
  \ related to the implementation of an amplitude modulation (AMP) signal with a sine\
  \ wave as the modulating function. This directory serves as a comprehensive repository\
  \ for all aspects of AMP modulation, including mathematical equations, code implementations,\
  \ and detailed explanations of the underlying principles.\n        The directory\
  \ contains 42 files in total, comprising 10 code files that implement the AMP algorithm\
  \ and its associated functions, 5 documentation files that provide a detailed description\
  \ of the AMP concept, mathematical derivations, and usage guidelines, and other\
  \ supporting files such as images and graphs.\n        The purpose of this directory\
  \ is to serve as a reference guide for researchers and developers interested in\
  \ exploring the various aspects of AMP modulation and its applications. By providing\
  \ a well-organized collection of resources, it helps these individuals to develop\
  \ their knowledge and expertise in the field and contribute to the advancement of\
  \ AMP technology."
