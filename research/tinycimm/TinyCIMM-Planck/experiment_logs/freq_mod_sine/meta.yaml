description: 'This directory structure appears to contain data and metadata related
  to an experiment involving the TinyCIMM model, specifically the frequency-modulated
  sine (freq_mod_sine) variant. The directory name suggests that the experiment involves
  the use of a Cosmic Information Mining Model (CIMM), which is a foundational research
  framework for post-symbolic artificial intelligence based on principles of entropy
  flow, collapse dynamics, and field-theoretic stabilization.


  The contents of this directory appear to include CSV files containing logs and metrics
  generated during the experiment. The file "meta.yaml" contains metadata about the
  experiment, including its schema version and the directory name. The "TinyplanckPlanck_planck_freq_mod_sine_log.csv"
  file appears to contain data on the step, loss, entropy, and neurons used during
  training, while the "TinyplanckPlanck_planck_freq_mod_sine_metrics.csv" file contains
  various metrics related to the experiment, including activation ancestry, entropy
  alignment, phase alignment, bifractal consistency, and attractor density.


  The purpose of this directory structure is likely to store and organize data generated
  during an experiment involving the TinyCIMM model, specifically the freq_mod_sine
  variant. The data stored in these files may be used for analysis, visualization,
  or further processing to gain insights into the behavior of the TinyCIMM model and
  its capabilities.'
