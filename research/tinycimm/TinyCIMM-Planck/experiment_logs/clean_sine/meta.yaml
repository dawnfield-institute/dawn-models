description: 'This directory contains the experimental data and metadata for a project
  related to Cosmic Information Mining Model (CIMM) and TinyCategorical Information
  Memory Matrix (TinyCIMM). The directory is titled "clean_sine," which suggests that
  it contains data collected during a sine wave-related experiment.


  The total number of files in the directory is 3, with 2 code files and 1 documentation
  file. However, only 5 samples from each type are shown here for brevity. The code
  files appear to be CSV logs containing metrics related to the CIMM model''s performance
  during training and testing. The documentation file contains metadata about the
  experiment, including the schema version and description of the semantic scope (TinyCIMM-Planck,
  experiment_logs, clean_sine).


  The contents of the directory appear to be a result of an experiment focused on
  understanding the relationship between symbolic entropy collapse and bifractal patterns
  in neural network weight evolution. The data collected may have been used to analyze
  deep mathematical structures that emerge during learning through entropy analysis
  or to demonstrate how lightweight, entropy-informed architectures can achieve adaptive
  learning, symbolic memory, and field-based intelligence using Dawn Field Theory
  principles.


  Overall, this directory serves as a record of an experimental investigation into
  the use of CIMM models for symbolic cognition and recursive collapse, with a focus
  on understanding the relationship between symbolic entropy collapse and bifractal
  patterns in neural network weight evolution. The data collected within may have
  contributed to the development of new insights or approaches related to these topics.'
