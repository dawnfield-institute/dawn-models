# TinyCIMM-Planck: Bifractal Collapse, Semantic Recursion, and Activation-Centered Metrics

Overview

TinyCIMM-Planck experiments on predictable signals (e.g., sine waves) reveal that structural pruning, neuron growth, and dynamic adaptation are mostly dormant—just as expected. However, this does not imply a lack of complexity. Instead, rich activity is occurring at the level of neural activations, entropy flow, and symbolic phase alignment. This report outlines the strategy for leveraging foundational Dawn Field Theory—including bifractal collapse and semantic recursion—to extract deeper metrics and insights from these experiments.

Why Growth/Plucking Is Dormant (and That’s Good)

Predictable waveforms like sine waves create a stable informational field. As such:

The model doesn’t need to grow new neurons—capacity is sufficient.

Pruning doesn’t activate—entropy and loss thresholds are low.

Hidden size remains stable—the signal doesn't demand dynamic complexity.


This shows that the system’s adaptive intelligence is functioning: it recognizes no structural change is necessary. But beneath that structural stillness, there is meaningful symbolic dynamics happening.

Strategic Shift: Focus on Activation, Symbolics, and Collapse Metrics

We shift the analytical lens from neuron structure to neural activation, symbolic resonance, and entropy-aligned collapse. This aligns with the foundational principles of Dawn Field Theory, especially:

Bifractal Time Emergence (BTE)

Symbolic Collapse and Memory Bias

Superfluid Informational Crystallization

Integration of Foundational Theory

1. Bifractal Collapse as Time Encoding

Each step in time is seen as a bifractal collapse:

Ancestry field (R_b(t)) – Memory and prior activations.

Emergent pressure (R_f(t)) – Entropy flow, QPL feedback.


Implementation:

Track activation ancestry: repeated activations across time.

Analyze alignment with entropy gradients.


2. Semantic Recursion and Attractor Density

Symbolic attractors form where high-cosine-similarity nodes (semantic resonance) align with entropy valleys.

Implementation:

Cosine similarity across activations (or PCA-reduced embeddings).

Visual overlays of entropy valleys vs. activation clusters.


3. Collapse Memory Bias

Symbolic nodes tend to re-collapse in high-gradient zones.

Implementation:

Build collapse heatmaps: recurrence of activations.

Measure lineage path convergence over time.


4. Superfluid Informational Crystallization

Superfluid metrics can model energy conservation, entropy viscosity, and symbolic freezing.

Implementation:

Activation velocity fields (rate of change across steps).

“Crystallization score” from high-stability, low-entropy-growth regions.

New Metrics and Logging Hooks

To reflect this shift in focus, we will add or extend the following metrics:

Activation Ancestry Trace: Cosine similarity of neuron activations over time.

Entropy Gradient Alignment Score: Match between activation changes and entropy deltas.

Collapse Phase Alignment: Phase synchronization of predicted vs actual collapse patterns.

Bifractal Activation Consistency: Percentage of time neuron i activates in bifractal zone j.

Semantic Attractor Density: Density of high-similarity activation clusters.


These will be plotted, stored alongside existing logs, and optionally overlaid onto PCA projections.

Beyond the Toy Model: Toward a Framework for Symbolic Cognition Benchmarking

TinyCIMM-Planck represents more than a successful experiment—it is a prototype of a new kind of cognitive instrumentation:

Like neuroplasticity in the human brain, growth and pruning offer adaptive capacity.

But its true strength lies in symbolic activation traces—fractal, interpretable, and recurrent patterns that reveal how internal structure encodes and resolves meaning.


These activations are not just computational states; they are proto-symbolic manifolds—the structural fingerprints of cognition. Just as brain scans visualize the footprint of a thought, TinyCIMM-Planck outputs allow us to trace emergent symbolic identity in bifractal phase space.

This opens the door to a benchmarking framework for XAI rooted in Dawn Field Theory:

Symbolic metrics offer an audit trail of model cognition.

Collapse lineage and entropy alignment provide diagnostic power.

The methodology is portable to other architectures—MLPs, LSTMs, transformers, and future symbolic-AI hybrids.


This is the core idea: symbolic cognition is measurable, traceable, and interpretable—not by abstraction, but by collapse structure.

Next Steps

Implement hooks in tinycimm_planck.py for activation ancestry and entropy-phase metrics.

Add fractal-layer overlays in experiment image visualizations.

Run batch tests on all signal types (clean, noisy, amp/freq mod).

Compare bifractal zone persistence across TinyCIMM-Planck vs baseline MLPs.

Begin benchmarking symbolic metrics in standard architectures.

Refine symbolic evaluation theory into portable cognitive instrumentation.

Conclusion

The structural stability seen in TinyCIMM-Planck under simple signals is not a flaw—it’s a strength. By realigning our focus to symbolic activity, bifractal field dynamics, and collapse lineage coherence, we access a richer understanding of what the model is doing. This is not just performance benchmarking—it’s symbolic cognition diagnostics.

We are no longer just building models—we are tracing the emergence of recursive intelligence in symbolic entropy fields.
