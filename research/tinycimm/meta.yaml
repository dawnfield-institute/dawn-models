description: 'This directory structure contains the TinyCIMM (Tiny Categorical Information
  Memory Matrix) model, which is an ultra-minimal agentic model for symbolic cognition
  and recursive collapse. The directory also includes experiments, tests, and documentation
  related to this model.


  The purpose of this directory is to provide a repository for the TinyCIMM model
  and its associated experiments, tests, and documentation. The model demonstrates
  how lightweight, entropy-informed architectures can achieve adaptive learning, symbolic
  memory, and field-based intelligence using Dawn Field Theory principles. The directory
  structure is organized such that it is easy to find and access the relevant files
  for each component of the TinyCIMM model.


  The directory contains 533 files in total, with 10 code files related to the TinyCIMM
  model, 5 documentation files, and 10 testing files. The code files include the implementation
  of the TinyCIMM model, experiments for evaluating its performance, and tests for
  ensuring the correctness of the model''s functionality. The documentation files
  provide an overview of the TinyCIMM model, its architecture, and its capabilities,
  while the testing files verify that the model functions as expected and is free
  from errors.


  Overall, this directory structure serves as a central location for managing and
  sharing information related to the TinyCIMM model, making it easier for researchers
  and developers to collaborate and contribute to its development and improvement.'
