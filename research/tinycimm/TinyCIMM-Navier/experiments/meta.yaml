description: 'This directory contains experimental code for the TinyCIMM-Navier Live
  CIMM system, which is designed to study the dynamics of symbolic cognition and recursive
  collapse. The directory includes several files and directories, each with a specific
  purpose and functionality.


  The main files in this directory are:


  * `config.live_cimm.yaml`: This file contains configuration settings for the TinyCIMM-Navier
  Live CIMM experiment runner. It specifies the seed, temperature, and other parameters
  used to control the behavior of the system.

  * `meta.yaml`: This file contains metadata about the directory itself, including
  its schema version and a brief description of its purpose.

  * `summarize_turbulent_sweep.py`: This file provides a Python script for summarizing
  the results of a TinyCIMM-Navier Live CIMM experiment run. It calculates various
  statistical metrics and generates visualizations to help analyze the results.

  * `test_scbf_integration.py`: This file contains integration tests for the SCBF
  (Symbolic Collapse Bifractal Framework) library used in the TinyCIMM-Navier Live
  CIMM system. The tests validate that the framework is working correctly and provide
  a basis for further testing.

  * `tinycimm_navier_dashboard.py`: This file contains a Python script for generating
  visualizations of the results of a TinyCIMM-Navier Live CIMM experiment run using
  the SCBF framework. The dashboard displays the results in a user-friendly format
  and provides insights into the dynamics of symbolic cognition and recursive collapse.


  These files are organized within the directory structure as follows:


  * `config/`: This directory contains configuration files for the TinyCIMM-Navier
  Live CIMM system, including `config.live_cimm.yaml`.

  * `data/`: This directory contains data files generated by the TinyCIMM-Navier Live
  CIMM experiment runner and summarized by the `summarize_turbulent_sweep.py` script.
  The data includes information about the system''s behavior, such as its entropy
  dynamics and pattern emergence.

  * `docs/`: This directory contains documentation files related to the TinyCIMM-Navier
  Live CIMM system, including `README.md`.

  * `experiments/`: This directory contains experimental code for running the TinyCIMM-Navier
  Live CIMM system and generating results. The main files in this directory are `run_live_cimm_experiment.py`,
  `test_scbf_integration.py`, and `tinycimm_navier_dashboard.py`.

  * `results/`: This directory contains result files generated by the TinyCIMM-Navier
  Live CIMM system, including `DASHBOARD_INDEX.md`. The results include visualizations
  of the system''s behavior and statistical metrics that summarize its performance.

  * `scbf/`: This directory contains the SCBF (Symbolic Collapse Bifractal Framework)
  library used in the TinyCIMM-Navier Live CIMM system. It includes files such as
  `scbf.py`, `utils.py`, and `tests`.

  * `test/`: This directory contains integration tests for the TinyCIMM-Navier Live
  CIMM system, including `test_scbf_integration.py`. These tests validate that the
  SCBF library is working correctly and provide a basis for further testing.'
