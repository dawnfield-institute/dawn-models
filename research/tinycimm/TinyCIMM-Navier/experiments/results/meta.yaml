description: 'The "results" directory stores the output of several experiments conducted
  with TinyCIMM-Navier, a specialized algorithm for symbolic cognition and recursive
  collapse. The directory contains 111 files, including 10 code files that were executed
  during the experimentation process and five documentation files that provide an
  overview of the results and their interpretation.


  The meta.yaml file is used to store metadata about the directory, such as its name,
  description, semantic scope, and other relevant details. The live_cimm_experiment_20250816_171852
  directory contains a DASHBOARD_INDEX.md file that serves as a dashboard for the
  experiment results.


  The TinyCIMM-Navier algorithm is designed to achieve adaptive learning, symbolic
  memory, and field-based intelligence using Dawn Field Theory principles. The results
  of these experiments demonstrate how lightweight, entropy-informed architectures
  can create fractal patterns in both temporal directions and provide insight into
  deep mathematical structures that emerge during learning through entropy analysis.


  In summary, the "results" directory serves as a central location for storing and
  organizing experimental results related to TinyCIMM-Navier, providing valuable insights
  into the algorithm''s capabilities and applications in symbolic cognition and recursive
  collapse.'
