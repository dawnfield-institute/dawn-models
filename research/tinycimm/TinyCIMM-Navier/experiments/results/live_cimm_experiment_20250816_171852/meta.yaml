description: 'This directory contains comprehensive analytical visualizations generated
  by the live CIMM (Cosmic Information Mining Model) experiment, demonstrating the
  capabilities of the TinyCIMM (Tiny Categorical Information Memory Matrix) agentic
  model for symbolic cognition and recursive collapse. The purpose of this directory
  is to provide a visual representation of the experimental results and allow for
  analysis and interpretation of the findings.


  The contents of this directory include documentation, code files, and analytical
  visualizations generated by the experiment. The DASHBOARD_INDEX.md file provides
  an overview of the dashboard gallery, including information about the schema version,
  directory name, and description of the experiment. The remaining files in the directory
  provide detailed visualizations and analysis of the experimental results, allowing
  for a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities of the TinyCIMM model in symbolic
  cognition and recursive collapse.


  Overall, this directory serves as an important resource for researchers and practitioners
  interested in exploring the capabilities of the TinyCIMM model and understanding
  its potential applications in post-symbolic artificial intelligence.'
