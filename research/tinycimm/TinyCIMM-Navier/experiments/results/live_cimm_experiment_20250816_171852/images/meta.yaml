description: "The \"images\" directory houses configuration files for the TinyCIMM-Navier\
  \ experiment, which is used to investigate the relationship between symbolic cognition,\
  \ recursive collapse, and bifractal patterns in neural network weight evolution.\
  \ The directory includes six files in total, with three code files and three documentation\
  \ files.\n\nThe \"meta.yaml\" file specifies the schema version of 2.0 and defines\
  \ the directory's semantic scope as simulation, experimentation, and machine learning.\n\
  \nThe \"directory_name\" describes the name of the directory and its purpose as\
  \ configuration files for the TinyCIMM-Navier experiment. The \"description\" field\
  \ provides more information about the content of the directory and its function.\
  \ \n\nOverall, the \"images\" directory serves as a central location for storing\
  \ and organizing all the files needed to run the TinyCIMM-Navier experiment."
