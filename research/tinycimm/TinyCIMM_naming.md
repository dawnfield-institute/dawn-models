# TinyCIMM Variant Naming Scheme

The TinyCIMM family of models uses a **math and physics-inspired naming convention** to distinguish between different architectural variants and experimental focuses. This scheme is designed to be both nerdy and systematic, making it easy to identify each model’s core characteristics and intended research domain.

---

## Naming Pattern

**TinyCIMM-[Scientist/Concept]**

- Each variant is named after a famous mathematician, physicist, or mathematical concept, reflecting the model’s dimensionality, domain, or unique features.

## Current and Planned Variants

| Name                | Description / Domain                        | Inspiration         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| TinyCIMM-Planck     | Minimal, foundational version (1D/2D)       | Max Planck (physics, smallest unit) |
| TinyCIMM-Gauss      | Higher-dimensional or vision-focused        | Carl Friedrich Gauss (geometry, multidimensionality) |
| TinyCIMM-Euler      | Number theory, sequence, or prime prediction| Leonhard Euler (number theory) |
| TinyCIMM-Turing     | Symbolic reasoning, language, or logic      | Alan Turing (computation, logic) |
| TinyCIMM-Mandelbrot | Chaotic, bifractal, or recursive dynamics   | Benoit Mandelbrot (fractals)     |

## Guidelines for New Variants

- **Choose a name** that reflects the model’s main innovation or research focus.
- **Keep the pattern:** `TinyCIMM-[Name]`
- **Document** the variant’s unique features and intended use in its module and experiment logs.

## Example Usage

- `TinyCIMM-Planck` — Minimal, entropy-regulated recurrent model for symbolic collapse benchmarking.
- `TinyCIMM-Gauss` — Vision or multidimensional input variant.
- `TinyCIMM-Euler` — Model for prime number or sequence prediction tasks.

*This naming scheme helps organize the TinyCIMM ecosystem and makes it easy to extend with new, thematically consistent models as research progresses.*
