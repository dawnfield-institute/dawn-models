# TinyCIMM Variant Naming Scheme

The TinyCIMM family of models uses a **math and physics-inspired naming convention** to distinguish between different architectural variants and experimental focuses. This scheme is designed to be both nerdy and systematic, making it easy to identify each modelâ€™s core characteristics and intended research domain.

---

## Naming Pattern

**TinyCIMM-[Scientist/Concept]**

- Each variant is named after a famous mathematician, physicist, or mathematical concept, reflecting the modelâ€™s dimensionality, domain, or unique features.

## Current and Planned Variants

| Name                | Description / Domain                        | Status | Inspiration         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------|---------------------|
| TinyCIMM-Planck     | Minimal, foundational version (1D/2D)       | âœ… Active | Max Planck (physics, smallest unit) |
| TinyCIMM-Euler      | Number theory, sequence, or prime prediction| âœ… Active | Leonhard Euler (number theory) |
| TinyCIMM-Navier     | Fluid dynamics and turbulence analysis      | âœ… Active | Claude-Louis Navier (fluid mechanics) |
| TinyCIMM-Gauss      | Higher-dimensional or vision-focused        | ðŸ”® Planned | Carl Friedrich Gauss (geometry, multidimensionality) |
| TinyCIMM-Turing     | Symbolic reasoning, language, or logic      | ðŸ”® Planned | Alan Turing (computation, logic) |
| TinyCIMM-Mandelbrot | Chaotic, bifractal, or recursive dynamics   | ðŸ”® Planned | Benoit Mandelbrot (fractals)     |

## Guidelines for New Variants

- **Choose a name** that reflects the modelâ€™s main innovation or research focus.
- **Keep the pattern:** `TinyCIMM-[Name]`
- **Document** the variantâ€™s unique features and intended use in its module and experiment logs.

## Example Usage

- `TinyCIMM-Planck` â€” Minimal, entropy-regulated recurrent model for foundational symbolic collapse benchmarking.
- `TinyCIMM-Euler` â€” Model for prime number, sequence prediction, and mathematical reasoning tasks.
- `TinyCIMM-Navier` â€” Fluid dynamics model exploring macro-to-micro emergence patterns in turbulent systems.
- `TinyCIMM-Gauss` â€” Future vision or multidimensional input variant.
- `TinyCIMM-Turing` â€” Future symbolic reasoning and language processing variant.
