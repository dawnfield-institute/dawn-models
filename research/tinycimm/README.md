# ðŸ§  TinyCIMM Model

TinyCIMM is Dawn Field Theoryâ€™s ultra-minimal agentic model for symbolic cognition and recursive collapse. It demonstrates how lightweight, entropy-informed architectures can achieve adaptive learning, symbolic memory, and field-based intelligence.

## ðŸ“š Contents
- `TinyCIMM-Euler/` â€“ Experiments and code for Euler-based symbolic collapse
- `TinyCIMM-Planck/` â€“ Planck-scale symbolic cognition experiments
- `TinyCIMM_naming.md` â€“ Naming conventions and semantic tags for TinyCIMM modules
- Additional scripts and modules for agentic benchmarking and collapse analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
TinyCIMM provides:
- Minimal, interpretable agentic cognition
- Benchmarking for symbolic collapse and memory
- Integration with SCBF and other Dawn Field Theory models

Explore TinyCIMM to see Dawnâ€™s core principles in action, or use it as a baseline for new symbolic agentic architectures.
