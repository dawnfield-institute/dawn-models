description: 'This directory "experiment_results" contains the experimental results
  generated by a machine learning model that utilizes the TinyCIMM framework to perform
  Euler''s method. The content within this folder comprises 126 files, including 10
  code files and 5 documentation files. It also includes a meta.yaml file that describes
  the schema version used for organizing the data in this directory.

  The results of this project demonstrate how TinyCIMM can be employed to perform
  Euler''s method. The purpose of this directory is to document and analyze these
  findings, providing insight into the capabilities of this framework. It serves as
  a valuable resource for researchers and developers who are interested in applying
  symbolic cognition and recursive collapse principles to machine learning models.'
