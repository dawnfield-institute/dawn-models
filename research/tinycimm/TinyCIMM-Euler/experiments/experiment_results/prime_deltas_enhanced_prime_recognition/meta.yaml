description: 'This directory contains code and documentation related to enhancing
  the recognition of primes in mathematics, particularly using the concepts and techniques
  of post-symbolic artificial intelligence. The directory is structured into subdirectories
  for various aspects of prime number recognition, including symbolic cognition, field-based
  intelligence, and entropy flow analysis.


  The code files in this directory are likely to be written in a programming language
  such as Python or C++ and are designed to perform specific tasks related to prime
  number recognition, such as analyzing prime numbers or generating new prime numbers.
  Some of the code files may also include functions for implementing the CIMM (Cosmic
  Information Mining Model), TinyCIMM (Tiny Categorical Information Memory Matrix),
  SCBF (Symbolic Collapse Bifractal Framework), and Epistemic Feedback (self-referential
  learning mechanism) described in the documentation.


  The documentation included in this directory is likely to provide an overview of
  the concepts and techniques used in prime number recognition, as well as a detailed
  explanation of the code files and their functions. This documentation may also include
  examples or case studies demonstrating the use of these techniques in practical
  applications.


  Overall, this directory is designed to serve as a resource for researchers and developers
  working on post-symbolic artificial intelligence and related fields, providing a
  collection of tools and techniques that can be used to enhance the recognition of
  primes and other mathematical structures.'
