description: This directory structure represents the implementation of various AI
  models, including the TinyCIMM model, which is an ultra-minimal agentic model for
  symbolic cognition and recursive collapse. The directory also includes a Global
  Adaptive Intelligence Architecture (GAIA) that enables complex reasoning and emergence
  in AI systems. Additionally, the directory contains logs, which provide configuration
  space for enhanced prime recognition. These logs serve as a container for parameters
  and dependencies that can be used to customize and optimize the models. The purpose
  of this directory is to provide a framework for the development and deployment of
  advanced AI models using principles of entropy flow, collapse dynamics, and field-theoretic
  stabilization, as well as self-referential learning mechanisms like epistemic feedback.
