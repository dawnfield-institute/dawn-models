description: This directory appears to be a collection of configuration files used
  in running experiments with the TinyCIMM-Euler model, which is an ultra-minimal
  agentic model for symbolic cognition and recursive collapse. The contents include
  12 files, including one meta.yaml file that defines the schema version and directory
  name, as well as documentation files that provide a detailed explanation of the
  experiment settings and configurations used in the TinyCIMM-Euler model. Overall,
  this directory is likely to be used for developing and testing machine learning
  models based on the TinyCIMM-Euler framework, with a focus on number theory, sequence
  prediction, and mathematical reasoning tasks.
