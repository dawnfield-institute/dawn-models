description: "This directory is named \"run_20250710_125505\" and contains the results\
  \ of a test that was conducted on the Fibonacci ratios convergence property. The\
  \ directory includes 12 files, with 10 code files and 5 documentation files. The\
  \ meta.yaml file contains information about the schema version and directory name,\
  \ and provides additional details about the purpose and contents of the directory.\n\
  \        \n        The directory is likely used to store the results of a test that\
  \ was conducted on the Fibonacci ratios convergence property, which is a fundamental\
  \ concept in mathematics that describes how certain sequences converge to a limiting\
  \ value as the number of terms increases. The directory may contain code files and\
  \ documentation files related to this test, such as data files, reports, or analysis\
  \ results.\n        \n        The purpose of this directory is to store and organize\
  \ the results of this test in a structured manner, making it easier for others to\
  \ access and analyze the results. By using a standardized naming convention and\
  \ schema version number, the directory can be easily integrated with other tools\
  \ and frameworks that support reproducible research and data analysis."
