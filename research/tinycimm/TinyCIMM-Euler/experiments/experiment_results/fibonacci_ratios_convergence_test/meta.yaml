description: 'The `fibonacci_ratios_convergence_test` directory is an archive containing
  data and documentation related to an experiment on the convergence of Fibonacci
  sequence ratios. The directory contains 25 files in total, with 10 code files and
  5 documentation files. The `meta.yaml` file at the root directory provides metadata
  for the entire project, including its schema version and directory name.


  The purpose of this directory is to contain all the experimental data and documentation
  related to the convergence study of Fibonacci sequence ratios. The code files contain
  the experiment''s code and algorithms, while the documentation files provide information
  on the methodology, results, and interpretation of the study. By organizing the
  files in a specific structure and naming them accordingly, this directory serves
  as a comprehensive repository for all the relevant data and information related
  to the experiment.'
