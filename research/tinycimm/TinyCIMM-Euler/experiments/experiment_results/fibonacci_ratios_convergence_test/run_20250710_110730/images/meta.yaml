description: "The \"images\" directory is intended for storing image files relevant\
  \ to the project. It is likely that the images are relevant to the project's content,\
  \ such as product photographs or user avatars. The presence of 9 total files in\
  \ this directory suggests that it may be a significant component of the project\
  \ and that the creators of the project have made an effort to organize their image\
  \ files effectively.\n        There are no code files in this directory, but it\
  \ is possible that there may be other code components present elsewhere within the\
  \ project that reference these images. The presence of documentation for the first\
  \ five files suggests that the creators of the project intend for the images to\
  \ be used as part of a larger narrative or story. Overall, the \"images\" directory\
  \ appears to be an essential component of the project and is likely to play a significant\
  \ role in conveying the intended message."
