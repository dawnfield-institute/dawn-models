description: This directory structure contains logs related to the TinyCIMM-Euler
  algorithm, a foundational research framework for symbolic cognition and recursive
  collapse. The directory contains the configuration files and metadata for the TinyCIMM-Euler
  algorithm, which is a lightweight, scalable, and efficient version of the CIMM (Cosmic
  Information Mining Model) that uses live entropy feedback, wave collapse equilibrium,
  and recursive field dynamics to achieve adaptive learning, symbolic memory, and
  field-based intelligence. The directory also includes documentation related to the
  TinyCIMM-Euler algorithm, including a description of its purpose, functionality,
  and role within a larger project.
