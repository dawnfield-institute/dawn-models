description: "The \"images\" folder is where you store your project's images. It can\
  \ include all kinds of pictures, from product photos to design mockups. This type\
  \ of data can be crucial in the creation of eye-catching visual content that highlights\
  \ a project's features and benefits. To ensure that images are properly optimized\
  \ for the web, they should have an appropriate file size and resolution. It is also\
  \ essential to pay close attention to image compression techniques and formats such\
  \ as JPEG or PNG, which can efficiently transmit information without sacrificing\
  \ quality.\n  The \"images\" directory may contain several types of files, including\
  \ code files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and others. However, they are not the primary\
  \ focus of this folder. Instead, it is dedicated to storing visual data such as\
  \ images, graphics, and photographs.\n  The contents of the \"images\" folder can\
  \ be described as a collection of graphical elements that support the purpose and\
  \ functionality of the project. They may include product photos, illustrations,\
  \ diagrams, and other visual assets."
