description: "This directory structure contains the configuration files necessary\
  \ for executing a TinyCIMM-Euler experiment. The directory is named after the date\
  \ and time of execution, highlighting the specific details surrounding this particular\
  \ experiment. This directory contains 12 files, which include code files, documentation,\
  \ and other metadata related to the experiment's execution.\nThe main file found\
  \ in the directory is meta.yaml, which specifies the schema version used to create\
  \ the files and specifies important experiment-related information such as the name\
  \ of the experiment and a brief description. The directory also contains additional\
  \ code files that provide the specific implementation for the TinyCIMM-Euler model.\
  \ \nThe documentation component of this directory is also crucial, providing a record\
  \ of the results obtained from the experiment and any insights or conclusions drawn\
  \ based on them. Overall, this directory provides an important tool for researchers\
  \ to analyze and evaluate the performance of the TinyCIMM-Euler model in various\
  \ situations and provide valuable insights into its functionality and capabilities."
