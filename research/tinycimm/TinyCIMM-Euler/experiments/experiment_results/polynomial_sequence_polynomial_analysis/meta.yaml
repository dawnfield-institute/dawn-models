description: "This directory contains code and documentation for analyzing and generating\
  \ polynomial sequences and polynomials, with a focus on the symbolic collapse bifractal\
  \ framework and the tiny cimmin model. The folder is designed to facilitate research\
  \ into various mathematical structures that emerge during learning through entropy\
  \ analysis, such as those found in neural networks. It includes tools for measuring\
  \ symbolic collapse and bifractal patterns in weight evolution, providing insight\
  \ into deep mathematical structures that can be used to improve machine learning\
  \ algorithms. \n\nAdditionally, the directory contains a TinyCIMM variant specialized\
  \ for number theory, sequence prediction, and mathematical reasoning tasks, named\
  \ after Leonhard Euler, who made significant contributions to mathematics. The tiny\
  \ cimmn model is an ultra-minimal agentic model that utilizes live entropy feedback,\
  \ wave collapse equilibrium, and recursive field dynamics to achieve adaptive learning,\
  \ symbolic memory, and field-based intelligence using Dawn Field Theory principles.\
  \ The SCBF framework provides a way to measure symbolic collapse and bifractal patterns\
  \ in neural network weight evolution, which can provide insight into deep mathematical\
  \ structures that emerge during learning through entropy analysis. \n\nOverall,\
  \ this directory is an important tool for researchers working in the field of post-symbolic\
  \ artificial intelligence, as it provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing\
  \ and generating polynomial sequences and polynomials, with a focus on understanding\
  \ the symbolic collapse bifractal framework and the tiny cimmin model."
