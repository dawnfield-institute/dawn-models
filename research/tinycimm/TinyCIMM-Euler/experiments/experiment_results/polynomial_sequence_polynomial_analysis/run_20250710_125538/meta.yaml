description: 'This directory contains the results of a specific experiment run for
  a polynomial sequence-polynomial analysis, using the Symbolic Collapse Bifractal
  Framework (SCBF) and Activation Ancestry (AAS) metrics to measure symbolic collapse
  and stability in neural network weight evolution. The directory includes 12 files,
  with 10 code files and 5 documentation files.


  The purpose of this directory is to store the results of a specific experiment run,
  providing insight into the deep mathematical structures that emerge during learning
  through entropy analysis. The SCBF metric measures symbolic collapse and bifractal
  patterns in neural network weight evolution, while the AAS metric tracks consistency
  of activation patterns over time and their stability under recursive feedback.


  The directory includes meta-data files such as `meta.yaml` that describe the schema
  version, directory name, and description of the results stored within it. The documentation
  files provide more detailed information about the experiment design, methodology,
  and results analysis.'
