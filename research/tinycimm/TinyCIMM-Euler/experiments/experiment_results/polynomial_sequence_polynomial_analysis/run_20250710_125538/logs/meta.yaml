description: "This directory contains configuration files for running TinyCIMM-Euler,\
  \ a variant of the Tiny Categorical Information Memory Matrix (TinyCIMM) model that\
  \ specializes in number theory, sequence prediction, and mathematical reasoning\
  \ tasks. The directory provides the necessary information for the program to run\
  \ the polynomial sequence analysis, as specified by the meta.yaml file's description\
  \ field.\n        The semantic_scope field includes config/ as a subdirectory, indicating\
  \ that this directory contains configuration files for TinyCIMM-Euler. These files\
  \ are used to set up and customize the model for specific tasks or environments.\
  \ By providing a clear understanding of what the directory contains and its purpose,\
  \ developers can better organize their codebase and create more efficient and effective\
  \ models."
