description: 'The "images" directory in this project appears to be a container for
  storing various image files, including both code and documentation. The directory
  contains 9 total files, with 10 code files and 5 documentation files.


  Based on the file structure and content samples provided, it appears that this directory
  is intended to house images related to the project, such as product screenshots
  or diagrams. The directory may also contain documentation related to these images,
  such as descriptions of their purpose or usage guidelines.


  The fact that there are both code and documentation files in the directory suggests
  that the images may be used in the project''s codebase or documentation, but it
  is not clear what specific functionality or role each image plays within the larger
  project.'
