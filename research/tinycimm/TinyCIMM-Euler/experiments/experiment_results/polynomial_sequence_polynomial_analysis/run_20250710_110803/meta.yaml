description: 'This directory structure contains the configuration files and documentation
  for a specific run of a CIMM-based model that utilizes SCBF to analyze the symbolic
  collapse and bifractal patterns in neural network weight evolution. The directory
  includes 12 files, with 10 code files and 5 documentation files. The meta.yaml file
  contains information about the schema version and directory name. The description
  field provides a brief overview of the purpose of the directory and its content.


  The purpose of this directory is to store the configuration files necessary to run
  the model, as well as the documentation necessary to understand and interpret the
  results generated by the model. The SCBF metric, Activation Ancestry Stability,
  and Semantic Attractors are all relevant concepts in understanding the behavior
  of the neural network during learning.


  In this directory, you can find the configuration files for the CIMM-based model,
  including the schema version, directory name, and description of the purpose of
  the directory. Additionally, you can find documentation on SCBF, Activation Ancestry
  Stability, and Semantic Attractors, which provide insight into the behavior of the
  neural network during learning and how these concepts contribute to the overall
  understanding of the model.'
