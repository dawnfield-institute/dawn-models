description: The `logs` directory in this project is used to store the output of a
  run of the TinyCIMM-Euler experiment for recursive sequence and patterns. The contents
  of this directory are likely the results of the experiment, such as the data generated
  by the TinyCIMM-Euler model during its execution. The `meta.yaml` file in this directory
  provides metadata about the experiment, including the schema version used and the
  directory name. The semantic scope of this directory is limited to the configuration
  files for the experiment, such as the `config` files mentioned in the `meta.yaml`.
