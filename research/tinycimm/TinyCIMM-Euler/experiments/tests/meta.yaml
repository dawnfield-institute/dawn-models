description: This directory tests mathematical experiments using TinyCIMM-Euler, a
  variant of the minimal agentic model for symbolic cognition and recursive collapse.
  The experiments demonstrate how lightweight, entropy-informed architectures can
  achieve adaptive learning, symbolic memory, and field-based intelligence using Dawn
  Field Theory principles. The directory contains code for testing these experiments,
  including "test_all_experiments.py" and "test_improved_primes.py".
