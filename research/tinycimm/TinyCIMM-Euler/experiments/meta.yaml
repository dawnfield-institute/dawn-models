description: 'This directory contains a set of experimental files and documentation
  for a breakthrough in mathematical reasoning through field-theoretic neural architecture
  using the TinyCIMM model. The experiment utilizes live entropy feedback, wave collapse
  equilibrium, and recursive field dynamics to achieve adaptive learning, symbolic
  memory, and field-based intelligence. The directory includes a total of 134 files,
  with 10 code files and 5 documentation files.


  The code files provide the necessary scripts for running the experiment, including
  `run_experiment.py`, `run_long_term_experiment.py`, and `run_online_experiment.py`.
  The tests folder contains two test files: `test_all_experiments.py` and `test_improved_primes.py`.


  The documentation includes a detailed description of the experiment, its purpose,
  and the mathematical background behind it. The file `[id][F][v2.0][C6][I6][E]_mathematical_reasoning_breakthrough.md`
  provides an overview of the experiment''s contribution to mathematical reasoning
  through field-theoretic neural architecture.


  Overall, this directory represents a significant breakthrough in the field of artificial
  intelligence and mathematics, demonstrating how field-theoretic neural architectures
  can achieve adaptive learning, symbolic memory, and field-based intelligence using
  entropy feedback and recursive balance fields.'
