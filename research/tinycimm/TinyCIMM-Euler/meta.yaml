description: >
  TinyCIMM-Euler implements fundamental pattern recognition capabilities for
  mathematical sequences through neural adaptation. Named after Leonhard Euler
  for its focus on mathematical elegance and pattern discovery, this variant 
  serves as the foundational model for sequence learning and mathematical 
  concept formation with SCBF interpretability integration.
