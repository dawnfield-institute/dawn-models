description: 'This directory structure represents a code module for the TinyCIMM-Euler,
  which is an implementation of the Quantum Bifractal Equilibrium (QBE) Controller,
  a novel approach to solving complex problems in AI. The TinyCIMM-Euler is a variant
  of the Cosmic Information Mining Model (CIM) that uses entropy feedback and wave
  collapse equilibrium to achieve adaptive learning, symbolic memory, and field-based
  intelligence. It also incorporates Dawn Field Theory principles for lightweight,
  entropy-informed architectures.


  The directory contains 136 files, with code files accounting for 25%, while documentation
  files make up the remaining 75%. The first 10 code files are essential to the module''s
  functionality, including ''tinycimm_euler.py'', ''experiments\run_experiment.py'',
  and ''experiments\run_long_term_experiment.py''. These files provide implementations
  of the QBE Controller''s key components, such as the TinyCIMM model and its various
  experimental settings.


  On the other hand, the first five documentation files in the directory provide a
  detailed overview of the module''s concepts and functionalities. They explain how
  the module achieves adaptive learning, symbolic memory, and field-based intelligence
  using Dawn Field Theory principles, as well as the mathematical reasoning behind
  the Quantum Bifractal Equilibrium (QBE) Controller.


  Overall, this directory structure represents a powerful tool for solving complex
  problems in AI through the use of novel approaches like the TinyCIMM-Euler.'
