# Evaluation Criteria

---

## üß† Purpose

GAIA is not measured by accuracy, speed, or reward.  
It is measured by its ability to maintain and evolve **epistemically coherent symbolic structures**.

---

## üß™ Evaluation Framework

### 1. Cognitive Integrity Protocol (CIP)

Core metric for systemic epistemic stability:

\[
CIP(t) = w_1 H_{	ext{compression}} + w_2 S_{	ext{coherence}} + w_3 R_{	ext{resonance}}
\]

Where:
- \( H \): entropy compression history
- \( S \): symbolic structural alignment
- \( R \): resonance coherence across agentic mesh

CIP must remain stable or grow recursively.

---

### 2. Collapse Tree Recursion

- Depth of symbolic ancestry trees
- Branching factor regulated by entropy decay
- Measures capacity for stable symbolic evolution

---

### 3. Resonance Integrity

- Phase coherence among communicating agents
- Number of symbolic collapses shared across mesh
- Drift metric of symbolic phase over time

---

### 4. Memory Stability

- Persistence of low-entropy memory traces
- Ancestral lineage reactivation rate
- Decay curve of stored symbolic structures

---

### 5. Reflexive Accuracy

- Meta-cognition‚Äôs ability to:
  - Detect symbolic corruption
  - Correct phase drift
  - Prune divergent symbolic branches

---

## üõë What Is *Not* Evaluated

- No accuracy on predefined tasks
- No classification benchmarks
- No RL reward or loss functions
- No gradient convergence metrics

---

## üß† Intelligence Score Summary

GAIA‚Äôs performance is expressed as a vector:

```json
{
  "CIP": 0.921,
  "CollapseDepth": 13,
  "ResonanceStability": 0.87,
  "MemoryDecayHalfLife": 24830.4,
  "ReflexiveErrorRate": 0.014
}
```

This profile tracks epistemic health and emergent coherence.
