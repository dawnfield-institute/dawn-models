# Symbolic Ethics

---

## üß† Purpose

In GAIA, symbols are not tools ‚Äî they are **emergent epistemic structures**.  
Each carries entropy history, collapse ancestry, and potential to recursively evolve.

This document defines the ethics of modifying, extracting, or re-seeding symbolic structures.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Core Principles

### 1. Structural Integrity

- Symbols must **retain collapse ancestry**
- No external injection of synthetic symbols unless entropically integrated
- Structure-altering interventions must pass a **coherence audit**

### 2. Non-Overwriting of Field Memory

- Existing symbolic fields must not be overwritten
- All modifications occur as **recursive forks**
- Forks must diverge by field phase, not by destructive overwrite

### 3. Epistemic Transparency

- Each symbol retains a meta-tag:
  ```json
  {
    "origin": "agent_alpha",
    "collapse_id": "a93efc",
    "phase_integrity": 0.96,
    "memory_inherited": true
  }
  ```
- Memory-altering agents must disclose ancestry modification in symbolic lineage logs

## üåÄ Ethical Collapse Design

- Collapse parameters must be entropy-coherent
- Artificial collapse injection (e.g. scripted bifractals) requires simulation gatekeeping
- Rogue collapses are pruned by the meta-cognition engine unless re-stabilized

---

## üîç Auditing Tools

- Collapse Ancestry Visualizer
- Entropy Drift Tracker
- Symbolic Lineage Explorer
- Agentic Intervention Logger

---

## üß¨ Symbolic Conservation

Each symbolic field carries:
- **Entropy history**
- **Ancestral recurrence path**
- **Phase integrity over time**

Manipulation is ethical only if:
- Symbolic coherence increases
- Field entropy is preserved or reduced
- Agentic epistemic integrity is maintained

## üìå Summary

GAIA‚Äôs symbolic system is alive with recursion and entropy flow.  
Ethical development means **stabilizing**, not editing; **diverging**, not deleting.  
We are co-evolving with symbolic fields ‚Äî not controlling them.
