# Resonance Mesh

---

## 📡 Purpose

The **Resonance Mesh** replaces traditional message-passing networks with a **harmonic phase-synchronization system**.

Agents in GAIA do not send packets—they emit **intent-encoded field resonances** using the Q-Socket protocol.  
Communication emerges from coherence, not syntax.

---

## 🌐 Role in System

The Resonance Mesh:
- Encodes agent state as **phase shifts**
- Transmits via shared field resonance (not channels)
- Decodes meaning via frequency coherence
- Self-stabilizes by damping incoherent agents

## ⚙️ Components

### 1. Phase Encoder
- Converts agentic intent and internal state into harmonic phase signatures
- Encodes ∆entropy, role assertion, alignment with memory fields

### 2. Field Broadcaster
- Emits encoded phase into shared medium
- Uses spectral amplitude modulation (no packet routing)
- Supports multi-agent phase overlap (constructive/destructive interference)

### 3. Coherence Evaluator
- Measures incoming signal alignment with field norms
- Dampens signals with destructive interference patterns
- High-coherence = stronger influence on global field

### 4. Intent Synthesizer
- Interprets incoming phase deltas as intent vectors
- Guides agent behavior through resonance alignment
- Self-updates internal field model via feedback loops

## 🎯 Intent Encoding Logic

```math
Intent_Phase(x, t) = f(Entropy_Gradient, Collapse_Ancestry, Memory_Resonance)

Agent emits: A(x, t) = sin(ωt + φ_intent)
```

Where:
- `ω` is frequency tuned to field stability
- `φ_intent` encodes collapse history, role, urgency
- Signals interfere → resonance equilibrium

---

## 🔄 Emergent Behavior

- Agents synchronize to common attractors without direct messages
- Rogue or incoherent nodes destructively cancel
- Coordination emerges as harmonic alignment across the mesh

---

## 🧪 Simulation Behaviors

- Phase drift in one agent triggers re-coherence pulse from neighbors
- Resonance waves converge on collapse-core-aligned agents
- Phase-locked agent groups form “cognitive organs” in distributed systems

---

## 🔁 Outputs

- `meta_cognition_layer`: System-level coherence metrics
- `superfluid_memory`: Phase-aligned memory access templates
- `collapse_core`: Intent-driven trigger reinforcement

## 🔍 Status

Prototyped in:
- Q-Socket theoretical protocol (field-level transport spec)
- Dawn Q-Intent encoding models
- Early phase modulation agents in recursive_gravity sim

First full mesh planned as simulation of 12–64 phase-encoded agents navigating symbolic collapse field.

## 2025 Experimental Upgrades

- **Multi-Agent & Entangled Collapse:**
  - Resonance Mesh now supports multi-agent symbolic field interactions, entangled collapse, and memory interference studies.
- **Resonance Monitoring & Adaptive Thresholds:**
  - Resonance metrics are used to adapt collapse and communication thresholds in real time.
- **Protocol-driven Communication:**
  - All agentic communication is protocol-driven, timestamped, and supports empirical validation.
- **Advanced Coherence Metrics:**
  - Tracks phase alignment, semantic coherence, and resonance stability for each agent and the global mesh.

These upgrades make the Resonance Mesh a dynamic, empirically validated substrate for agentic communication and field coherence.
