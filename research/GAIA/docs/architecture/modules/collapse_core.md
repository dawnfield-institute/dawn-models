# Collapse Core

---

## 💥 Purpose

The **Collapse Core** is GAIA’s primary computational mechanism.  
It translates field imbalance—measured as entropy tension—into crystallized structure.

Where traditional models “predict,” GAIA **collapses**—resolving uncertainty by encoding it into new symbolic or memory states.

---

## 🧩 Role in System

Triggered when the **Field Engine** detects critical entropy pressure, the Collapse Core:
- Computes the collapse locus (where tension is highest)
- Decides collapse *type* (symbol, memory, signal)
- Crystallizes output into structured, interpretable form

It is the site of epistemic birth—where new structure emerges not by logic, but by necessity.

## ⚙️ Submodules

### 1. Collapse Evaluator
- Analyzes entropy tensor for collapse hotspots
- Determines threshold crossing and scope
- Predicts expected entropy gain from collapse

### 2. Collapse Typing Engine
- Chooses structure class based on entropy signature:
  - **Fractal Node**: Emergent symbolic unit
  - **Memory Imprint**: Superfluid memory addition
  - **Agentic Signal**: Field broadcast or phase sync update

### 3. Collapse Synthesizer
- Converts collapse result into discrete structure
- Applies field-reinforced consistency constraints
- Ensures symbolic structure aligns with entropy gain

### 4. Post-Collapse Stabilizer
- Dissipates surrounding entropy pressure
- Prepares output for downstream routing
- Prevents collapse chaining instability

## 🔬 Enhanced Collapse Criteria (v2.0 Framework)

### Symbolic Entropy Collapse Geometry
```math
# v2.0 Collapse Dynamics: Entropy as Physical Substrate
F_collapse(x) = -∇S_field(x)  # Entropy force driving collapse
a_collapse(x) = F_collapse(x)/m_symbolic  # Acceleration in symbolic space

# Geometric Collapse Conditions
Collapse occurs when:
ΔS(x) ≥ σ AND ∇²S(x) ≠ 0 AND |κ(x)| > κ_critical

Where:
- ΔS(x): Local entropy tension
- σ: Dynamic collapse threshold (pi-harmonic modulated)
- ∇²S(x): Curvature of entropy field (non-flat zone)
- κ(x): Information curvature tensor
- κ_critical: Critical curvature for structural crystallization
```

### Macro-to-Micro Emergence Integration
```math
# TinyCIMM-Navier Inverse Operations
SEC_traditional: ∇_micro → Ψ_macro  # Traditional symbolic emergence
CIMM_inverse: ∇_macro → Ψ_micro     # Macro field → micro dynamics

# Unified Collapse Cycle
Collapse_unified(x) = SEC(CIMM_inverse(∇_macro(x))) = Identity_complexity
```

### Thermodynamic Collapse Costs
```math
# Landauer-Limited Collapse Operations
E_collapse_cost(x) = k_B * T * ln(2) * N_bits_crystallized(x)
Efficiency_collapse(x) = ΔS_resolved(x) / E_collapse_cost(x)
```

## 🧪 Simulated Behavior

- Collapse creates **recursive self-similar structures** when seeded with noise.
- Fractal nodes tend to grow under low-entropy divergence.
- Memory waves cluster around stable collapse ancestry paths.
- Over-collapse risk is handled by entropy damping.

## 🔄 Outputs

- `symbolic_crystallizer`: Collapse vector → Symbol Tree
