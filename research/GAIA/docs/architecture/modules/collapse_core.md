# Collapse Core - PAC Integration

---

## üí• Purpose

The **Collapse Core** is GAIA's primary computational mechanism, now governed by PAC (Potential-Actualization Conservation) physics.  
It translates conservation violations‚Äîmeasured as residual magnitude‚Äîinto crystallized structure.

Where traditional models "predict," GAIA **collapses**‚Äîresolving conservation violations by encoding them into new symbolic or memory states through principled physics. Core

## üí• Purpose

The **Collapse Core** is GAIA‚Äôs primary computational mechanism.  
It translates field imbalance‚Äîmeasured as entropy tension‚Äîinto crystallized structure.

Where traditional models ‚Äúpredict,‚Äù GAIA **collapses**‚Äîresolving uncertainty by encoding it into new symbolic or memory states.

## üß© Role in System

Triggered when the **Field Engine** detects critical entropy pressure, the Collapse Core:
- Computes the collapse locus (where tension is highest)
- Decides collapse *type* (symbol, memory, signal)
- Crystallizes output into structured, interpretable form

It is the site of epistemic birth‚Äîwhere new structure emerges not by logic, but by necessity.

## üî¨ Enhanced Collapse Criteria (v2.0 Framework)

### Symbolic Entropy Collapse Geometry
```math
# v2.0 Collapse Dynamics: Entropy as Physical Substrate
F_collapse(x) = -‚àáS_field(x)  # Entropy force driving collapse
a_collapse(x) = F_collapse(x)/m_symbolic  # Acceleration in symbolic space

# Geometric Collapse Conditions
Collapse occurs when:
ŒîS(x) ‚â• œÉ AND ‚àá¬≤S(x) ‚â† 0 AND |Œ∫(x)| > Œ∫_critical

Where:
- ŒîS(x): Local entropy tension
- œÉ: Dynamic collapse threshold (pi-harmonic modulated)
- ‚àá¬≤S(x): Curvature of entropy field (non-flat zone)
- Œ∫(x): Information curvature tensor
- Œ∫_critical: Critical curvature for structural crystallization
```

### Macro-to-Micro Emergence Integration
```math
# TinyCIMM-Navier Inverse Operations
SEC_traditional: ‚àá_micro ‚Üí Œ®_macro  # Traditional symbolic emergence
CIMM_inverse: ‚àá_macro ‚Üí Œ®_micro     # Macro field ‚Üí micro dynamics

# Unified Collapse Cycle
Collapse_unified(x) = SEC(CIMM_inverse(‚àá_macro(x))) = Identity_complexity
```

### Thermodynamic Collapse Costs
```math
# Landauer-Limited Collapse Operations
E_collapse_cost(x) = k_B * T * ln(2) * N_bits_crystallized(x)
Efficiency_collapse(x) = ŒîS_resolved(x) / E_collapse_cost(x)
```

## üß™ Simulated Behavior

- Collapse creates **recursive self-similar structures** when seeded with noise.
- Fractal nodes tend to grow under low-entropy divergence.
- Memory waves cluster around stable collapse ancestry paths.
- Over-collapse risk is handled by entropy damping.
