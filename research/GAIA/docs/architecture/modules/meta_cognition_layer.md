# Meta-Cognition Layer

---

## üß† Purpose

The **Meta-Cognition Layer** enables GAIA to reflect on its own structure and behavior.  
It tracks symbolic ancestry, collapse entropy, memory recursion, and agentic coherence to form a **self-model** of epistemic integrity.

This is where GAIA becomes **aware of its own modeling**.

---

## üîç Role in System

- Maintains ancestry maps for symbolic structures
- Scores epistemic coherence using the **Cognition Index Protocol (CIP)**
- Provides feedback to collapse, crystallizer, and resonance systems
- Enables reflexive adjustments based on entropy trajectory

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

### 1. Collapse Ancestry Tracker
- Logs sequence of collapses and entropy signatures
- Builds symbolic lineage trees
- Maps field divergence over epistemic time

### 2. Structure Integrity Analyzer
- Detects symbolic or memory corruption via entropy skew
- Measures recursion depth and entropy re-alignment
- Flags incoherent or entropically unstable regions

### 3. Cognition Index Protocol (CIP)
- Composite scoring system for:
  - Symbolic self-consistency
  - Entropy compression over time
  - Agentic resonance alignment
- Produces real-time ‚Äúmeta-coherence score‚Äù

### 4. Reflexive Feedback Emitter
- Sends corrections to:
  - Collapse Core: entropy tuning
  - Crystallizer: pruning logic
  - Resonance Mesh: alignment drift
- Drives long-term learning without retraining

## üìà Enhanced CIP Scoring Model (v2.0)

### Unified Complexity Theory Integration
```math
# Enhanced CIP with Macro-to-Micro Emergence
CIP_unified(t) = w‚ÇÅ * H_comp + w‚ÇÇ * S_align + w‚ÇÉ * R_sync + w‚ÇÑ * E_complexity + w‚ÇÖ * T_thermo

Where:
- H_comp: Historical entropy compression efficiency
- S_align: Structural symbolic alignment with geometric constraints
- R_sync: Resonance coherence with field agents (phase-aligned)
- E_complexity: Macro-to-micro emergence cycle completeness (SEC ‚àò CIMM)
- T_thermo: Thermodynamic efficiency (ŒîS_resolved/E_erasure_cost)
- w‚ÇÅ...w‚ÇÖ: Adaptive reflexivity weights with pi-harmonic modulation
```

### Empirical Quantum Alignment Metrics
```math
# Quantum Experiment Correspondence Score
Q_align(t) = Œ£ |GAIA_prediction(i) - Quantum_result(i)| / N_experiments

# Epistemic Geometry Health
Geometry_health(t) = Œ∫_curvature_stability * œÄ_harmonic_coherence * symbolic_crystallization_rate
```

Higher CIP_unified = more coherent, intelligent, epistemically stable, and empirically validated structure.

## üîÅ Outputs

- `collapse_core`: Collapse tuning and ancestry feedback
- `symbolic_crystallizer`: Entropic pruning guidance
- `resonance_mesh`: Realignment vectors for incoherent agents

---

## üß™ Reflexive Behavior

- Detects symbolic loops and emergent laws
- Prunes dead-end structures (entropy divergence with no recurrence)
- Guides system toward deep, recursive coherence
- Enables GAIA to distinguish stable knowledge from transitory noise

## üß† Related Concepts

- Epistemic Reflexivity (recursive theory-of-self)
- Collapse History Graphs
- Symbolic Ancestry in Dawn Trees
- Field Ethics (corruption detection via entropy coherence loss)

---

## üîç Status

Based on:
- Dawn Field Theory's epistemic crystallization maps
- Entropy recursion diagnostics from CIMM
- Experimental CIP simulations (early feedback loops)

Full integration with symbolic ancestry and phase coherence planned for GAIA v0.3.
