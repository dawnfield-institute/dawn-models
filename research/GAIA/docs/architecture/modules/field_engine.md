# Field Engine

---

## üß† Purpose

The **Field Engine** simulates the continuous interaction between **Energy** and **Information** fields.  
Its function is to measure **entropy tension**, compute **field pressure**, and trigger **collapse events** when the system deviates from balance.

This is where GAIA‚Äôs intelligence *begins*‚Äîas a physical manifestation of dynamic tension between computational states.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

### 1. EnergyField
- Represents kinetic potential, activation flux, or systemic excitation.
- Calculated as local flux gradient across input tensor or system state.
- Can be seeded with synthetic stimuli or external field injections.

### 2. InformationField
- Represents structured potential‚Äîregularity, symbolic alignment, entropy compression.
- Derived from input structure, memory alignment, or crystallized forms.
- Evolves via recursive refinement and symbolic entropy minimization.

### 3. Entropy Tensor
- Measures deviation between EnergyField and InformationField.
- Tracks Von Neumann entropy, Quantum Fisher Information, and structural irregularity.
- Also tracks local entropy density and potential information content.

### 4. Balance Controller
- Core module computing pressure ‚àÜ between energy and information.
- Output: `Collapse Likelihood`, `Field Pressure`, `Delta Entropy`, `Potential Structure`.
- If pressure exceeds threshold, triggers the Collapse Core.

## üßÆ Core Equations (Enhanced v2.0 Framework)

### Classical Field Physics (v2.0 Integration)
```math
# Entropy Field Physics (from v2.0 Collapse Dynamics)
S_field(x,t) = entropy field at position x, time t
F_entropy(x) = -‚àáS_field(x)  # Entropy force (analogous to F = -‚àáV)
a_collapse(x) = F_entropy(x)/m_info  # Collapse acceleration

# Energy-Information Field Dynamics
Œ¶_E(x) = ‚àá¬∑E(x)   # Energy divergence
Œ¶_I(x) = ‚àá¬∑I(x)   # Information compression gradient

ŒîS(x) = H(Œ¶_E(x)) - H(Œ¶_I(x))   # Entropic tension

# Macro-to-Micro Emergence (TinyCIMM-Navier Integration)
‚àá_macro ‚Üí Œ®_micro  # Macro field structures ‚Üí micro neural dynamics
SEC_inverse(x) = CIMM_operation(‚àá_macro(x))  # Unified complexity cycle

# Enhanced Collapse Triggering
CollapseTrigger(x) = 1 if ŒîS(x) > œÉ AND |‚àá_macro(x)| > œÑ
```

### Thermodynamic Cost Integration
```math
# Landauer Erasure Cost for Field Operations
E_erasure = k_B * T * ln(2) * N_bits_erased
Cost_field_op(x) = E_erasure + E_entropy_manipulation(x)

# Pi-Harmonic Collapse Modulation
œâ_collapse(x) = œâ_base * (œÄ/2)^(depth_recursion(x))
```

Where:
- `Œ¶_E` is energy field divergence
- `Œ¶_I` is symbolic information divergence
- `H()` is entropy function (e.g., Von Neumann, Shannon)
- `œÉ` is balance tolerance threshold

## üß™ Simulation Behavior

When seeded with imbalanced energy/information:
- Field pressure builds
- Entropy delta increases
- Collapse is triggered
- System crystallizes structure into symbolic node or memory orbit

## üîÑ Output to Downstream Modules

- `collapse_core`: Trigger signal + tension field snapshot
- `symbolic_crystallizer`: Seeds for bifractal structure
- `superfluid_memory`: Field signatures for macro-memory cohesion

## üîç Status

Partially adapted from:
- CIMM‚Äôs EntropyMonitor
- Dawn Field's collapse field simulation
- Infodynamics Tensor Algebra prototype

**Planned upgrade**: GPU-native parallel field tension model with live entropy decay visualization.
