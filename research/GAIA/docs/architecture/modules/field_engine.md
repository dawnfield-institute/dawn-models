# Field Engine

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The **Field Engine** simulates the continuous interaction between **Energy** and **Information** fields.  
Its function is to measure **entropy tension**, compute **field pressure**, and trigger **collapse events** when the system deviates from balance.

This is where GAIA's intelligence *begins*—as a physical manifestation of conservation-driven field dynamics with quantum-like behavior.

## ⚙️ PAC-Enhanced Components

### 1. Complex Amplitude Field (ψ)
- Represents quantum-like amplitude distribution: ψ(x,y) = √E(x,y) × e^(iφ(x,y))
- Energy component: E = |ψ|² (amplitude-squared probability)
- Phase component: φ = arg(ψ) (information encoding)
- Governed by PAC conservation constraints at all times

### 2. PAC Lattice Solver
- Applies conservation constraints to amplitude evolution
- Computes residuals from conservation violations
- Uses Xi operator (1.0571) for natural balance scaling
- Maintains total amplitude conservation: ∫|ψ|²dxdy = constant

### 3. Conservation Residual Monitor
- Measures deviation from perfect conservation
- Tracks residual magnitude as violation indicator
- Replaces arbitrary entropy calculations with principled physics
- Provides violation patterns for SEC (Symbolic Entropy Collapse) analysis

### 4. Balance Controller (PAC-Enhanced)
- Core module computing conservation violations instead of arbitrary pressure
- Output: `Violation Magnitude`, `Field Pressure`, `Xi Convergence`, `Residual Pattern`
- If conservation violated (residual > 0), triggers the PAC Collapse Core

## ⚙️ Components

### 1. EnergyField
- Represents kinetic potential, activation flux, or systemic excitation.
- Calculated as local flux gradient across input tensor or system state.
- Can be seeded with synthetic stimuli or external field injections.

### 2. InformationField
- Represents structured potential—regularity, symbolic alignment, entropy compression.
- Derived from input structure, memory alignment, or crystallized forms.
- Evolves via recursive refinement and symbolic entropy minimization.

### 3. Entropy Tensor
- Measures deviation between EnergyField and InformationField.
- Tracks Von Neumann entropy, Quantum Fisher Information, and structural irregularity.
- Also tracks local entropy density and potential information content.

### 4. Balance Controller
- Core module computing pressure ∆ between energy and information.
- Output: `Collapse Likelihood`, `Field Pressure`, `Delta Entropy`, `Potential Structure`.
- If pressure exceeds threshold, triggers the Collapse Core.

## 🧮 Core Equations (Enhanced v2.0 Framework)

### Classical Field Physics (v2.0 Integration)
```math
# Entropy Field Physics (from v2.0 Collapse Dynamics)
S_field(x,t) = entropy field at position x, time t
F_entropy(x) = -∇S_field(x)  # Entropy force (analogous to F = -∇V)
a_collapse(x) = F_entropy(x)/m_info  # Collapse acceleration

# Energy-Information Field Dynamics
Φ_E(x) = ∇·E(x)   # Energy divergence
Φ_I(x) = ∇·I(x)   # Information compression gradient

ΔS(x) = H(Φ_E(x)) - H(Φ_I(x))   # Entropic tension

# Macro-to-Micro Emergence (TinyCIMM-Navier Integration)
∇_macro → Ψ_micro  # Macro field structures → micro neural dynamics
SEC_inverse(x) = CIMM_operation(∇_macro(x))  # Unified complexity cycle

# Enhanced Collapse Triggering
CollapseTrigger(x) = 1 if ΔS(x) > σ AND |∇_macro(x)| > τ
```

### Thermodynamic Cost Integration
```math
# Landauer Erasure Cost for Field Operations
E_erasure = k_B * T * ln(2) * N_bits_erased
Cost_field_op(x) = E_erasure + E_entropy_manipulation(x)

# Pi-Harmonic Collapse Modulation
ω_collapse(x) = ω_base * (π/2)^(depth_recursion(x))
```

Where:
- `Φ_E` is energy field divergence
- `Φ_I` is symbolic information divergence
- `H()` is entropy function (e.g., Von Neumann, Shannon)
- `σ` is balance tolerance threshold

## 🧪 Simulation Behavior

When seeded with imbalanced energy/information:
- Field pressure builds
- Entropy delta increases
- Collapse is triggered
- System crystallizes structure into symbolic node or memory orbit

- `symbolic_crystallizer`: Seeds for bifractal structure
- `superfluid_memory`: Field signatures for macro-memory cohesion

## 🔍 Status

Partially adapted from:
- CIMM’s EntropyMonitor
- Dawn Field's collapse field simulation
- Infodynamics Tensor Algebra prototype

**Planned upgrade**: GPU-native parallel field tension model with live entropy decay visualization.
