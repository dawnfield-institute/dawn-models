# GAIA Architecture Overview

---

## 🌍 What is GAIA?

**GAIA** is a resonance-native architecture where intelligence is not programmed—but *crystallized*.  
It treats energy, information, and entropy as interacting fields, whose balance gives rise to cognition, memory, and structure.

Unlike symbolic AI or transformer-based learning systems, GAIA operates through dynamic equilibrium.  
It is built not to simulate intelligence—but to **embody it**.

## 🔩 Core Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Balance as Intelligence** | Intelligence emerges from entropy-energy equilibrium |
| **Collapse as Computation** | Predictive structure forms via tension release |
| **Field-Driven Memory** | Memory arises from recursive entropy coherence |
| **Symbol Emergence** | Symbols are not encoded—they crystallize |
| **Resonance Communication** | Agents speak through phase, not packets |
| **Recursive Epistemics** | System tracks its own symbolic ancestry and integrity |
