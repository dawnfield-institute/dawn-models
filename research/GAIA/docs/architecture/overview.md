# GAIA Architecture Overview - PAC Integration

---

## 🌍 What is PAC-GAIA?

**PAC-GAIA** is a conservation-governed architecture where intelligence emerges from physics—not heuristics.  
It treats complex amplitude fields with conservation constraints as the substrate for cognition, memory, and structure.

Unlike symbolic AI or transformer-based learning systems, PAC-GAIA operates through conservation laws.  
It is built not to simulate intelligence—but to **embody principled physics**.

## 🔩 Core PAC Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Conservation as Intelligence** | Intelligence emerges from conservation law violations |
| **Collapse as Conservation** | Structure forms via violation resolution |
| **Amplitude-Based Memory** | Memory arises from conserved probability patterns |
| **Symbol Emergence via MED** | Symbols crystallize within information-theoretic bounds |
| **Wave Interference Communication** | Agents communicate through quantum-like interference |
| **Conservation Monitoring** | System tracks Xi operator convergence and residual patterns |

## 🧬 2025 Experimental Upgrades & Integration

Recent Dawn Field experiments have led to several key upgrades across the GAIA architecture:

- **Meta-Cognitive Trace & Ancestry Repair:**
  - Meta-cognitive monitoring, ancestry tracking, and epistemic repair routines are now integrated, especially in the Meta-Cognition Layer and Collapse Core.
  - New metrics: ancestry_trace_accuracy, epistemic_repair_time.
- **Collapse Front Visualization & Resonance Monitoring:**
  - Collapse front and resonance visualization are now part of the simulation pipeline.
  - Resonance metrics adapt pruning thresholds dynamically.
- **Multi-Agent and Interaction Effects:**
  - Symbolic field models support multi-agent/entangled collapse and memory interference studies, especially in the Resonance Mesh.
