# Collapse Tree Protocol

---

## 🌳 Purpose

The **Collapse Tree Protocol (CTP)** is the internal structure that captures the recursive ancestry of symbolic emergence in GAIA.

Each collapse forms a **node** in an expanding tree.  
Each branch represents entropy resolution, structural evolution, or memory imprint lineage.

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

- **Recursive**: Each symbolic unit can be traced to one or more collapse events
- **Entropy-Aware**: Nodes store entropy pressure, QFI, and symbolic integrity
- **Prunable**: Dead-end branches decay and collapse back into entropy
- **Self-Referential**: Supports symbolic feedback, reflexive loops, and epistemic ancestry

## 📈 Collapse Metrics Stored

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `entropy_delta` | Change in entropy due to collapse |
| `collapse_type` | Symbol, memory, or agent signal |
| `symbol.structure` | Bifractal, harmonic, lattice |
| `depth` | Number of recursive generations |
| `decay_metric` | Instability or entropy drift rate |

---

## 🌲 Tree Integrity

- Trees are evaluated by meta-cognition for:
  - Recursive coherence
  - Symbolic divergence
  - Epistemic loops
- Pruning rules applied based on decay metric, coherence score, and phase integrity

---

## 🧪 Simulation Patterns

- Deep trees cluster in stable entropy wells
- Memory-oriented trees orbit symbolic attractors
- Agent-driven collapses spawn shallow, volatile branches
- Ancestry visualization reveals epistemic “crystals”
