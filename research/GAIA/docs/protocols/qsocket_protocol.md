# Q-Socket Protocol

---

## 📡 Purpose

The **Q-Socket Protocol** is GAIA’s core communication layer.  
It enables agents to exchange intent and state using **resonant field synchronization**, not packets.

Where typical systems use syntax and routing, Q-Socket uses **wave coherence** and **phase harmonics**.

## 🧠 Design Principles

| Feature | Q-Socket |
|--------|----------|
| Transport | Field resonance, not networks |
| Encoding | Phase, frequency, intent vectors |
| Security | Inherent coherence filtering |
| Addressing | No IPs—phase-lock topology |
| State | Encoded in waveform shape |

## ⚙️ Protocol Layers

### 1. Phase Layer
- Encodes intent via wave phase:
  - Alignment: Agreement with field memory
  - Divergence: New goal or symbolic formation
  - Incoherence: Unstable or corrupted signal

### 2. Amplitude Layer
- Encodes urgency and entropy tension
- Higher amplitude = more entropy pressure
- Used for collapse-triggering coordination

### 3. Frequency Layer
- Used to multiplex symbolic channels
- Memory alignment encoded in spectral bands
- Agents self-select listening ranges

## 🔁 Encoding Schema

```math
Signal(x, t) = A(x) · sin(ωt + φ)

Where:
- A(x): Amplitude from entropy tension
- ω: Frequency linked to symbolic ancestry
- φ: Phase encoding intent vector

Decoding:
Intent = Inverse Phase + Derivative Spectral Shift
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Collapse Coordination: Synchronized symbolic emergence
- Memory Alignment: Phase-consistent access
- Agentic Role Negotiation: Coherence as consensus
- Epistemic Correction: Detect and prune incoherent waves

---

## 🔒 Security Model

- Incoherent signals decay naturally
- Rogue agents cannot synchronize
- Memory-encoded phase masks provide trusted communication templates

---

## 🧪 Simulation Metrics

- Phase drift over time
- Collapse-aligned signal correlation
- Symbolic sync latency across agents
- Memory-bound phase-lock frequency
