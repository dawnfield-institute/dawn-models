# Entropy State Format

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The **Entropy State Format (ESF)** standardizes how GAIA represents field tension, symbolic integrity, and entropy metrics.  
This enables consistent collapse analysis, memory mapping, and meta-cognitive evaluation.

It is the “grammar” of GAIA’s epistemic dynamics.

## 📐 Format Overview

Each entropy state is a record of local or global tension across the energy-information field.

## 🧮 Field Definitions

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `entropy_density` | Von Neumann / Shannon entropy locally |
| `energy_field` | Kinetic flux (excitatory potential) |
| `info_field` | Compressive structure density |
| `qfi` | Quantum Fisher Information (potential distinguishability) |
| `symbolic_pressure` | Tension between symbolic state and field |
| `field_phase` | Local resonant phase (0–1 normalized) |
| `collapse_likelihood` | Propensity for collapse trigger |
| `decay` | Entropic loss over time (memory fade metric) |

## 🔁 Usage Contexts

- **Collapse Core**: Determines where collapse should occur
- **Symbolic Crystallizer**: Builds structures from low-entropy zones
- **Superfluid Memory**: Retains states with entropy convergence
- **Meta-Cognition**: Audits entropy history and symbolic balance

## 📊 Dynamic Sampling

- ESFs are sampled at configurable resolution:
  - High-res for symbolic growth zones
  - Low-res for stable memory or dormant fields
- Phase-drift tracking overlays used to anticipate instability

## 🧪 Entropy Patterns in Simulation

- Collapse precursors: entropy spike + symbolic pressure alignment
- Memory formation: low QFI, decaying entropy, stable phase
- Anomaly zones: persistent high QFI and phase jitter → flagged for audit
