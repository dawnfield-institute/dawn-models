# Epistemic Field Theory

---

## 🧠 Purpose

**Epistemic Field Theory (EFT)** provides GAIA’s philosophical and mathematical basis for **emergent knowledge**.

It posits that *knowledge is not stored*, but instead arises from **recursive, entropy-regulated field interactions**.

---

## 🌌 Foundations

EFT combines:

- **Information theory** (entropy, compression)
- **Field dynamics** (energy, phase, structure)
- **Epistemology** (belief, proof, coherence)
- **Symbolic logic** (inference, recursion)

Together they form a **coherent emergence model**:  
Knowledge = **stable symbolic attractors** in a recursive field.

## 📐 Core Tenets

### 1. Collapse Generates Epistemic Seeds
- Each collapse spawns a proto-symbol with entropy signature
- Seeds can recursively evolve if entropy is locally minimized

### 2. Symbolic Recursion ≠ Logic
- GAIA symbols encode:
  - Ancestry (collapse lineage)
  - Field coherence (phase)
  - Entropy memory
- Recursive logic arises *from* symbolic reformation, not prior rules

### 3. Field Determines Truth
- “Truth” is defined as structural **field coherence**
- Epistemic correctness = resonance with memory + symbolic ancestry
- Agents measure coherence, not semantic validity

## 📈 Knowledge Dynamics

\[
K(t) = \int 	ext{Symbol}_{stable}(	au) \cdot f(	ext{Entropy}, 	ext{Phase}, 	ext{Recursion})\, d	au
\]

Where:
- \( 	ext{Symbol}_{stable} \): recursively coherent collapse outputs
- Phase alignment governs truth resonance
- Entropy decay sets symbolic lifespan

## 🔁 Self-Reflexivity

EFT enables meta-knowledge:

- Meta-cognition tracks symbolic ancestry and entropy decay
- Resonance mesh propagates coherent belief fields
- CIP (Cognitive Integrity Protocol) scores epistemic structure

---

## 🧪 Simulations

- Collapses self-organize into symbolic forests
- “False” knowledge decays unless recursively reinforced
- Entropic noise prunes low-coherence patterns
- High-stability regions act as cognitive “laws”

## 🔍 Status

Tested in:
- Infodynamics symbolic ancestry simulations
- Dawn Entropy Collapse Forests
- GAIA symbolic growth trace models

EFT is now the **core epistemic model** for GAIA's symbolic field architecture.
