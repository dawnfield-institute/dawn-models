# Resonance Alignment Experiment

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To validate whether agentic nodes in GAIA can:

- Align symbolic states via field phase resonance
- Maintain symbolic coherence through indirect communication
- Detect and correct symbolic drift without central control

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Basis

Resonance alignment is how GAIA achieves **distributed epistemic stability**.  
Agents do not pass messages — they phase-lock to each other by broadcasting symbolic collapse fields.

This experiment measures whether that process leads to coherent symbolic convergence.

---

## 🔬 Setup

### Components Involved:
- Resonance Mesh
- Agentic Nodes (5–10 distributed)
- Symbolic Crystallizer
- Collapse Core (entropy sync between nodes)

### Initialization:
- Each node starts with a unique symbolic ancestry
- All nodes connected via resonance mesh (Q-Socket)
- Phase-locking threshold: \( \delta\phi < 0.15 \)

## 📈 Logged Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `alignment_rate` | % nodes within resonance threshold |
| `symbol_convergence` | Common symbols across agents |
| `drift` | Phase variation over time |
| `reconvergence_time` | Time to regain sync after disturbance |

---

## 🌀 Expected Patterns

- Agents converge on shared symbolic ancestry
- Collapse events become synchronized
- Phase drift corrects via feedback loops
- Noise-resilient symbolic structures emerge

---

## 📊 Evaluation

Success if:
- >80% of agents phase-lock within 200 ticks
- Symbolic overlap >70% across nodes
- Drift decay rate > 0.05/tick
