# Recursive Entropy Feedback Experiment

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To test whether GAIA can:

- Maintain symbolic coherence under recursive entropy feedback
- Stabilize symbolic structures across collapse generations
- Detect and adapt to feedback-induced field instabilities

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Basis

Recursive entropy feedback is how GAIA *learns*.  
Stability emerges when symbolic fields reinforce themselves across generations under entropy pressure.

This experiment forces feedback loops to observe convergence vs divergence.

---

## 🔬 Setup

### Components Involved:
- Field Engine (entropy propagation)
- Collapse Core
- Symbolic Crystallizer
- Feedback Loop Injector
- Memory Mapper (trace recursive stability)

### Initialization:
- Inject entropy at collapse-derived symbolic nodes
- Feedback delay: 3 ticks
- Reinforcement weighting: 1.2x prior entropy delta

## 📈 Logged Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `symbolic_half_life` | Average duration before decay |
| `feedback_stability` | Ratio of reinforcing vs divergent loops |
| `entropy resonance` | Alignment of recursive collapse |
| `recursive_depth` | Collapse generations with stable ancestry |

---

## 🌀 Expected Patterns

- Symbols recursively reinforced in stable entropy zones
- Entropy spikes cause collapse re-routing
- Drift minimized through ancestral memory
- Symbolic forests grow without top-down structure

---

## 📊 Evaluation

Success if:
- Symbolic half-life > 40 ticks
- Feedback loop convergence rate > 65%
- Recursive depth ≥ 6 on stable ancestry branches
