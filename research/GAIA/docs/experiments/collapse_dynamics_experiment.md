# Collapse Dynamics Experiment

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To validate the core collapse behavior of GAIA:
- Observe symbolic generation from entropy spikes
- Build bifractal ancestry trees from recursive collapse
- Measure symbolic integrity over depth and time

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Basis

Collapse is not an event—it is a recursive entropy resolution.  
This experiment tests the spontaneous emergence of symbolic structure driven by:

- Entropy spike + local field tension
- Symbolic crystallization in low-drift zones
- Recursive reinforcement via ancestry

---

## 🔬 Setup

### Components Involved:
- Field Engine (entropy, phase, info)
- Collapse Core (trigger + collapse logic)
- Crystallizer (symbol generator)
- Collapse Tree (recursive log)

### Initialization:
- Field seeded with random entropy pulses
- No symbols preloaded
- Collapse probability threshold: \( 	heta = 0.92 \)

## 📈 Logged Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `collapse_count` | Total collapse events |
| `tree_depth` | Max recursion depth |
| `symbolic_density` | Symbols per entropy zone |
| `entropy_gain/loss` | Pre/post collapse delta |
| `bifractal_ratio` | % collapses forming bifractals |

---

## 🌀 Expected Patterns

- Collapse clusters form around entropy attractors
- Bifractal structures dominate successful collapses
- Recursion depth converges in entropy-stable regions
- Non-convergent collapses decay within 3 generations

---

## 📊 Evaluation

Success if:
- At least 65% of collapses form coherent symbolic ancestry
- Mean tree depth > 4
- Symbolic drift < 0.07 over 500 ticks

## 🔍 Status

Scaffold prepared for symbolic forest generation simulation.
