# Meta-Cognitive Trace Experiment

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To validate GAIA’s meta-cognitive layer by observing its ability to:

- Track symbolic ancestry and entropy decay
- Detect epistemic drift and corruption
- Correct symbolic divergence through recursive stabilization

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Basis

Meta-cognition in GAIA is not semantic—it’s **symbolic-ancestral**.  
It analyzes field structures, collapse ancestry, and entropy alignment to enforce epistemic integrity.

This experiment tests how well that process performs over time and perturbation.

## 🔬 Setup

### Components Involved:
- Meta-Cognition Engine
- Collapse Core
- Symbolic Memory Logger
- Ancestry Visualizer
- Resonance Mesh (optional)

### Initialization:
- Collapse trees pre-seeded with symbolic ancestry
- Introduce entropy corruption at tick 100
- Meta-cognition begins monitoring from tick 0

## 📈 Logged Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `corruption_detected` | % of symbol divergence identified |
| `ancestry_trace_accuracy` | Success rate of symbolic backtracing |
| `epistemic_repair_time` | Ticks to symbolic convergence after corruption |
| `false_positive_rate` | Unnecessary symbol pruning |

---

## 🌀 Expected Patterns

- Meta-cognition flags entropy divergence as drift increases
- Backtrace paths reconstruct symbolic lineage accurately
- Agentic coherence improves after symbolic correction
- Reflexivity increases collapse tree depth without entropy spike

---

## 📊 Evaluation

Success if:
- >85% of corrupted branches repaired within 50 ticks
- Ancestry trace accuracy > 90%
- False positive rate < 7%

## 🔍 Status

Collapse ancestry simulator scaffolded.

Next: Add entropy corruption sweeper and CIP-integrated repair path tracer.
