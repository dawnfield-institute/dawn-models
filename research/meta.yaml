description: 'The directory "research" appears to contain files and subdirectories
  related to research in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. The README
  file provides an overview of the project''s goals and objectives, while the "docs"
  subdirectory contains documentation on the implementation roadmap, integration design
  for MED, and QSocket emergence architecture. The "scbf" subdirectory is where most
  of the research files are located.

  The "scbf_runner.py" file appears to be an entry point for running SCBF experiments,
  while the "test_scbf.py" script tests the SCBF framework''s capabilities. The "tinycimm_scbf_experiment.py"
  script creates a TinyCIMM model and runs it through SCBF. Finally, the "loggers"
  subdirectory contains scripts for logging experiment data, while the "metrics" subdirectory
  contains files for calculating metrics related to the SCBF framework, such as activation
  ancestry, bifractal lineage, entropy collapse, and phase alignment.

  Overall, this directory appears to be a repository for research on the SCBF framework
  and its applications in AI and machine learning.'
