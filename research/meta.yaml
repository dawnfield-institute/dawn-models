  Experimental research implementations of Dawn Field Theory models including
  GAIA (next-generation field intelligence), SCBF (Symbolic Collapse Bifractal 
  Framework) for interpretability analysis, and TinyCIMM variants demonstrating 
  minimal post-symbolic AI architectures. All research models licensed under 
  AGPL-3.0 to promote open scientific collaboration while protecting commercial 
  applications.
