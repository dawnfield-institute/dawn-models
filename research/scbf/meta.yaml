description: 'The SCBF (Symbolic Collapse Bifractal Framework) is a research framework
  for analyzing the emergence of symbolic structures in neural networks. This directory
  contains all the code and resources necessary to perform symbolic collapse benchmarking
  experiments using the SCBF framework. It includes source code, test cases, documentation,
  and experimental results.


  The purpose of this directory is to provide a central location for SCBF-related
  research, data analysis, and visualization. The files and directories within this
  structure are organized in a way that facilitates collaboration and reproducibility
  across different researchers and institutions.


  Inside this directory, you will find the following:


  * Code files: These are the Python source code files that implement the SCBF framework
  and its associated algorithms.

  * Test cases: These are unit tests and integration tests that verify the correctness
  of the code and ensure it can be executed correctly.

  * Documentation: This includes the README file, which provides an overview of the
  project and its goals, as well as additional documentation on the SCBF framework
  and its components.

  * Experimental results: These are the output files generated by running the experiments,
  which include visualizations, metrics, and other data that can be used to analyze
  and interpret the results.


  Overall, this directory provides a structured approach to symbolic collapse benchmarking
  using the SCBF framework, allowing researchers to easily reproduce and extend existing
  work while also contributing new insights and ideas.'
