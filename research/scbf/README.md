# � SCBF: Symbol## 🎯 Purpose
SCBF provides:
- Interpretability framework that measures symbolic collapse and bifractal patterns
- Deep mathematical structure analysis during neural network learning
- Entropy-based insights into emergent symbolic representations
- Integration with Dawn Field Theory's core models (TinyCIMM, CIMM)
- Visual and quantitative analysis tools for symbolic pattern formationlapse Bifractal Framework

This directory contains the code, experiments, and metrics for the Symbolic Collapse Bifractal Framework (SCBF), Dawn Field Theory's interpretability framework for measuring symbolic collapse and bifractal patterns in neural network weight evolution.🧩 SCBF: Symbolic Collapse Benchmark Framework

This directory contains the code, experiments, and metrics for the Symbolic Collapse Benchmark Framework (SCBF), Dawn Field Theory’s suite for explainable AI and symbolic benchmarking.

## 📚 Contents

- `metrics/` – Symbolic collapse, entropy, and interpretability metrics
- `loggers/` – Tools for tracking collapse events, lineage, and entropy
- `visualization/` – Collapse heatmaps, PCA/t-SNE overlays, and narrative dashboards
- `tinycimm_scbf_experiment.py` – Integration with TinyCIMM for agentic benchmarking
- `scbf_runner.py` – Main benchmarking suite runner
- `test_scbf.py` – Test scripts for framework validation
- `utils/` – Utility functions and modules

## 🎯 Purpose
SCBF provides:
- Modular benchmarking for symbolic collapse and agentic models
- Visual and quantitative interpretability tools
- Protocol-driven, reproducible experiments for XAI research
- Integration with Dawn Field Theory’s core models (TinyCIMM, GAIA, CIMM)
