directory_name: plots
description: This directory contains a collection of plots generated from the SCBF
  experiments conducted on the tinycimm-fibonacci-ratios dataset. The plots provide
  visual representations of the symbolic collapse and bifractal patterns in the neural
  network weight evolution during learning. The directory serves as a record of these
  findings, allowing for further analysis and interpretation of the data.
