description: 'This directory contains configuration files for an Artificial Intelligence
  (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) project. Specifically, it is designed to manage and
  optimize hyperparameters for various AI models, including the Cosmic Information
  Mining Model (CIMM), the Tiny Categorical Information Memory Matrix (TinyCIMM),
  and their variants such as TinyCIMM-Euler and TinyCIMM-Planck. The directory also
  includes documentation for the project, including a text file with results_location
  information.


  The purpose of this directory is to provide a central location for managing and
  optimizing the hyperparameters of various AI models within an ML project. By storing
  configuration files in this directory, the hyperparameters can be easily shared,
  modified, and tracked as the project progresses. Additionally, this directory provides
  a standardized way to document and organize the results of the project, making it
  easier for team members to understand and build upon the work done so far.'
