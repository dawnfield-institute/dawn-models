description: 'This directory contains the plots used in the project, which serve as
  visual representations of data. The files in this directory are primarily code-based
  and contain functions that generate specific types of plots based on the input data.
  The documentation contained within the first five files provides insight into the
  functionality and role of each plot within the larger project.


  The purpose of this directory is to provide a means for users to visualize and analyze
  data in a more comprehensive manner than simple statistical analysis. By generating
  various types of plots, such as line graphs, bar charts, and scatter plots, users
  can gain a deeper understanding of their data''s trends and patterns.


  Overall, the plots directory plays a crucial role in enhancing the usability and
  functionality of the project by providing users with a visual representation of
  their data that can be used to make more informed decisions.'
