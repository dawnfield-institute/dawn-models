description: 'This directory appears to contain the configuration files for a TinyCIMM
  algorithm that is specifically designed to handle tasks related to symbolic cognition
  and field-based intelligence. The TinyCIMM framework has been developed as an ultra-minimal
  agentic model, which uses entropy-informed architectures to achieve adaptive learning,
  symbolic memory, and field-based intelligence.

  The directory contains 14 files in total, with the code files being the first 10
  and the documentation files comprising the last five. The meta.yaml file contains
  information about the schema version used and the description of the directory.
  The name "20250713_101847" suggests that this is a specific experiment conducted
  on July 13th, 2025 at 10:18 PM, and the description specifies the use case as implementing
  a polynomial sequence with a length of 10,000. The documentation file appears to
  contain an experiment summary.

  The directory''s purpose is likely to house configuration files for the TinyCIMM
  algorithm, which can be used to optimize its performance on tasks related to symbolic
  cognition and field-based intelligence.'
