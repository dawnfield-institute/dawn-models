description: "This directory \"plots\" appears to be part of a larger research project\
  \ involving the application of computational intelligence methods to the study of\
  \ symbolic cognition. The plots stored in this folder are likely used to analyze\
  \ the performance of a mathematical model that uses the TinyCIMM approach for symbolic\
  \ memory and field-based intelligence, as well as the impact of live entropy feedback\
  \ on neural network weight evolution. \nThe plots provide insight into deep mathematical\
  \ structures that emerge during learning through entropy analysis, demonstrating\
  \ how lightweight, entropy-informed architectures can achieve adaptive learning,\
  \ symbolic memory, and field-based intelligence using Dawn Field Theory principles.\
  \ The use of this approach is crucial for understanding the nature of post-symbolic\
  \ artificial intelligence and its potential to revolutionize human cognition and\
  \ communication."
